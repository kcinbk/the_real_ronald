I have recently been staying quiet and letting others carry the conversation, but some moments demand that we speak. This is one of those moments. I think many of us feel the same weight right now, and putting some of it into words may help us carry it or at least help me carry the weight I feel.\n\nCharlie\u2019s death hit me hard. I know it hit many of you the same way. Our lives crossed paths. Because of this place I have faced threats, anger and isolation.  We all have crossed paths with his voice and his message, and when someone like him is taken from us, it isn\u2019t just another headline it feels personal. It forces us to look at our families, our lives, and to recognize how fragile it all is. What happened to him could have happened to any of us, and that truth is burdensome.\n\nCharlie was never about violence. He was about speaking, about engaging, about truth. He wanted peace. He wanted conversations, even when they were uncomfortable. He wanted people to think, to challenge, but not to hate. That\u2019s what made him effective, and that\u2019s why his loss hurts so deeply.\n\nIn the days after his death, we\u2019ve seen the usual two sides, worldwide we have seen compassion and friends we didn't know we had, but many others (often who we knew about) with cruelty, bitterness, and mockery. To me, this points to something bigger going wrong in our country. We have a mental health crisis that\u2019s growing worse every year. People are isolated, families are broken, drugs and depression are everywhere, and anger has become a way of life. Too many people are drowning in hate because they don\u2019t know love, don\u2019t know God, and don\u2019t know how to deal with the pain inside them. And when these voices are amplified, when they\u2019re given platforms, they often become louder than the voices of peace and reason. That\u2019s why so many cheer death instead of life. That\u2019s why they call for violence instead of conversation. That\u2019s the reality we\u2019re facing, and it\u2019s not just a political issue, it\u2019s a human issue, a spiritual crisis, a challenge to our society.  We have lost civics and civility.   It has been abandoned by our schools, our neighbors and our society. \n\nCharlie warned us about this. He showed us that hate cannot drive out hate. It must be met with truth, with conversation, with faith, and with love. The people who mock, who rage, who act like our very existence is a problem they aren\u2019t strong. They\u2019re broken. And this fight isn\u2019t just political, it\u2019s spiritual. The world has become a place where anger feels normal and patience feels weak. But we know better. Love, conversation, and understanding have power.\n\nSo what do we do now? For me, the answer is faith, family, and country. Faith first, because without God, we are drifting. God is our anchor when the world feels unstable, the compass that points us back to what\u2019s right, the light that helps us see even when darkness surrounds us. Family next, because the real work, the real impact, begins at home. Be present. Be patient. Hold your children and families closer. Give them slightly longer hugs. Show them extra patience and compassion when you feel downtrodden, when your fuse burns a little too long. Your anger isn\u2019t directed at them. They need your love most when the world feels darkest. Our children and families are the future of this country. If we teach them love, faith, and patience, we give them the tools to survive a world that often feels cruel and chaotic. And then country, because America is worth fighting for not with hate, not with blind rage, but with conviction, with service, and with a commitment to the values that built this nation. America is strongest when we put God first, keep faith at the center of our lives, and hold our communities together.\n\nPart of honoring Charlie is also taking responsibility as a community. This isn\u2019t just about individuals, it\u2019s about noticing the people around us who are struggling, reaching out to them, listening, offering support. Sometimes that means a quiet word. Sometimes it means helping someone get real help. If we can help even a few people before the darkness overwhelms them, then we\u2019ve made a difference. That\u2019s how we build resilience, and that\u2019s how we carry forward the lessons Charlie tried to teach.\n\nWe also need spiritual courage. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed by anger, frustration, or grief. It\u2019s easy to see the brokenness around us and wonder if our efforts matter. But they do. Every act of patience, every conversation that seeks understanding, every gesture of love and service, they ripple out. They matter. They build a foundation for others to follow.

His voice may be quiet now, but his work lives on in each of us. Every time we speak truth, every time we show patience, every time we hold our families close, and every time we put America first in how we live and lead, we carry his flame forward.

I have recently been staying quiet and letting others carry the conversation, but some moments demand that we speak. This is one of those moments. I think many of us feel the same weight right now, and putting some of it into words may help us carry it or at least help me carry the weight I feel.</p>\n<p>Charlie\u2019s death hit me hard. I know it hit many of you the same way. Our lives crossed paths. Because of this place I have faced threats, anger and isolation.  We all have crossed paths with his voice and his message, and when someone like him is taken from us, it isn\u2019t just another headline it feels personal. It forces us to look at our families, our lives, and to recognize how fragile it all is. What happened to him could have happened to any of us, and that truth is burdensome.</p>\n<p>Charlie was never about violence. He was about speaking, about engaging, about truth. He wanted peace. He wanted conversations, even when they were uncomfortable. He wanted people to think, to challenge, but not to hate. That\u2019s what made him effective, and that\u2019s why his loss hurts so deeply.</p>\n<p>In the days after his death, we\u2019ve seen the usual two sides, worldwide we have seen compassion and friends we didn't know we had, but many others (often who we knew about) with cruelty, bitterness, and mockery. To me, this points to something bigger going wrong in our country. We have a mental health crisis that\u2019s growing worse every year. People are isolated, families are broken, drugs and depression are everywhere, and anger has become a way of life. Too many people are drowning in hate because they don\u2019t know love, don\u2019t know God, and don\u2019t know how to deal with the pain inside them. And when these voices are amplified, when they\u2019re given platforms, they often become louder than the voices of peace and reason. That\u2019s why so many cheer death instead of life. That\u2019s why they call for violence instead of conversation. That\u2019s the reality we\u2019re facing, and it\u2019s not just a political issue, it\u2019s a human issue, a spiritual crisis, a challenge to our society.  We have lost civics and civility.   It has been abandoned by our schools, our neighbors and our society.</p>\n<p>Charlie warned us about this. He showed us that hate cannot drive out hate. It must be met with truth, with conversation, with faith, and with love. The people who mock, who rage, who act like our very existence is a problem they aren\u2019t strong. They\u2019re broken. And this fight isn\u2019t just political, it\u2019s spiritual. The world has become a place where anger feels normal and patience feels weak. But we know better. Love, conversation, and understanding have power.</p>\n<p>So what do we do now? For me, the answer is faith, family, and country. Faith first, because without God, we are drifting. God is our anchor when the world feels unstable, the compass that points us back to what\u2019s right, the light that helps us see even when darkness surrounds us. Family next, because the real work, the real impact, begins at home. Be present. Be patient. Hold your children and families closer. Give them slightly longer hugs. Show them extra patience and compassion when you feel downtrodden, when your fuse burns a little too long. Your anger isn\u2019t directed at them. They need your love most when the world feels darkest. Our children and families are the future of this country. If we teach them love, faith, and patience, we give them the tools to survive a world that often feels cruel and chaotic. And then country, because America is worth fighting for not with hate, not with blind rage, but with conviction, with service, and with a commitment to the values that built this nation. America is strongest when we put God first, keep faith at the center of our lives, and hold our communities together.</p>\n<p>Part of honoring Charlie is also taking responsibility as a community. This isn\u2019t just about individuals, it\u2019s about noticing the people around us who are struggling, reaching out to them, listening, offering support. Sometimes that means a quiet word. Sometimes it means helping someone get real help. If we can help even a few people before the darkness overwhelms them, then we\u2019ve made a difference. That\u2019s how we build resilience, and that\u2019s how we carry forward the lessons Charlie tried to teach.</p>\n<p>We also need spiritual courage. It\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed by anger, frustration, or grief. It\u2019s easy to see the brokenness around us and wonder if our efforts matter. But they do. Every act of patience, every conversation that seeks understanding, every gesture of love and service, they ripple out. They matter. They build a foundation for others to follow. They push back, in small but real ways, against the hate and despair threatening our communities.</p>\n<p>Charlie may be gone, but his message isn\u2019t. His voice may be quiet now, but his work lives on in each of us. Every time we speak truth, every time we show patience, every time we hold our families close, and every time we put America first in how we live and lead, we carry his flame forward. That flame isn\u2019t about anger. It\u2019s about hope, strength, faith, and love. It\u2019s about choosing life over despair, conversation over conflict, and love over hatred.</p>\n<p>I am well aware of those of you who think &quot;war&quot; or &quot;violence&quot; is the only answer.  I cannot speak to that, but I can pray that violence or war is not what our country faces.  That outcome will not be won by anyone and our country, that we love, will cease to exist.   I trust in Trump and God that the avenues of our future will awaken a new peace and understanding from those who lie and speak ill of us.

With a commitment to strengthen our communities, protect our families, and address the mental health crisis that affects so many in silence.
