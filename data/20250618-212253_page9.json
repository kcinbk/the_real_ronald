NSFL, either. But we have to understand what's been going on. Do I personally believe this story? Yes.\r\n\r\nTL; DR - Iran claims to have hacked into a Mossad database and obtained the evidence we all want: That of ritual child sexual abuse among the elites of the world. Iran claims that Israel started the current bombing in an effort to hide this evidence.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nThe story goes like this ...\r\n\r\nOn June 3rd, the Knesset (Israel's legislature) held a special session to hear testimony of alleged victims of their years-long sexual abuse as children. They said the perpetrators where high-level members in the government, including CURRENT Knesset members, police, and other government officials.\r\n\r\nThey testified that they filed complaints over many years, but investigations were always shut down.\r\n\r\nKnesset heard their testimony on June 3rd.\r\n\r\nFour days later, on June 7th, Iran announced it had hacked into a Mossad database, claiming it had highly sensitive data, images, and video. Speculation is it included the secret Mossad blackmail archives. But this story was silenced in western media.\r\n\r\nFive days after that, Israel unleashed an attack of war against Iran, purportedly over suspected nuclear facilities.\r\n\r\nBut Bibi has been telling that tale for (literally) 30 years.\r\n\r\nWhat is the REAL story?\r\n\r\nSo, far I have only found an article from the Jerusalem Post describing the Knesset session and testimony given on June 3rd. It seems that testimony really did happen.\r\n\r\nThe Iranian hack story (if true) has not been covered by western press, AFAIK.\r\n\r\nHere is the entire article from the Jerusalem Post:\r\n\r\nSurvivors testify: MKs participated in sadistic sexual 'rituals' involving minors\r\n\r\n\u2018Doctors, educators, police officers, and past and present members of the Knesset were involved in these abuses,\u2019 survivor says.\r\n\r\n(Warning: The following contains sensitive material, reader discretion is advised.)\r\n\r\nSeveral women on Tuesday testified in the Knesset about sexual abuse they suffered as minors as part of religious ritual ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe testimonies came during a joint meeting of the Knesset\u2019s Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality, chaired by MK Pnina Tameno-Shete (National Unity), and the Special Committee on Young Israelis, chaired by MK Naama Lazimi (The Democrats).\r\n\r\nThe joint meeting was organized in the wake of an investigative report published on April 2 by Israel Hayom journalist Noam Barkan.\r\n\r\nYael Ariel, one of the abuse survivors, shared: \u201cI experienced ritual abuse over many years until my late teens and was forced to harm other children. I chose to speak out and make my voice heard. I received threats after revealing my story. From age five to age 20, I was harmed in these ceremonies.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Ariel, she received testimonies from several women who claimed that doctors, educators, police officers, and past and present members of the Knesset were involved in these abuses.\r\n\r\n\u201cI filed a complaint with the police that was closed after a few months, and I know of other cases that were closed. Speaking out today in the Knesset is a historic moment,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nAnother survivor, Yael Shitrit, testified: \u201cYou have no idea what ritual abuse is. The human brain cannot comprehend it. You can\u2019t imagine what it means to program a three-year-old girl through rape and sadism so they can do whatever they want without anyone knowing.\r\n\r\n\u201cTheir trafficking of me happened all over the country. They moved me from ceremony to ceremony. Naked men stood in a circle. My therapist, her husband, and her son harmed me, and there were dozens of other girls and boys who harmed me.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were ceremonies and rituals meant to make me forget,\u201d Shitrit continued. \u201cThe police have known about this for a year, but they don\u2019t have the tools to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThe people who will fall are very, very senior figures. These people run communities and government agencies. They threaten us. I have children I need to protect. Something needs to be set up that can deal with this.\r\n\r\nThey tried to make us like them \u2013 the people who caused us endless pain,\u201d Shitrit said. \u201cYour role is to make this stop in Safed, Jerusalem, Jaljulya, or anywhere else,\u201d she declared.\r\n\r\nDR. NAAMA GOLDBERG, head of an NGO called Lo Omdot MeNegged (Hebrew for \u201cNot Standing Idly By\u201d), which assists prostitution survivors, explained that the depictions are sometimes so gruesome that they are hard to believe, but this incredulity serves the abusers, who convince victims not to complain by arguing that they will not be believed.\r\n\r\n\u201cSeveral years ago, I received descriptions of sadistic abuse of children,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThe accounts sounded absurd. [But] the testimonies kept coming and would not let up. They described gang rape by men, and sometimes by women. The abuse was filmed, and drugs were used. There were ritual practices and symbolism.\r\n\r\n\u201cI presented the police with written testimonies from five women. To this day, no one has contacted me. Since the report, additional testimonies have surfaced,\u201d Goldberg said.\r\n\r\nA representative of the Israel Police, Ch.-Supt. Anat Yakir, said that there was a national unit reviewing all cases and that the complaints were \u201ca top priority in the intelligence division.\u201d\r\n\r\nThese testimonies are a 'watershed moment'\r\n\r\nMKs who attended the meeting were visibly shaken by some of the testimonies, with one calling it a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and another calling the revelations \u201ctitanic.\u201d\r\n\r\nTameno-Shete said, \u201cReality shows us that the police are not strong in handling sexual offenses. No one wants to talk about brutal rape and children being raped. There are unimaginable cases of monstrosity here.\u201d\r\n\r\nLazimi added, \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe when I heard about a network of ritual abuse against girls and the fact that there is an organized and dangerous mechanism and nothing is being done to stop it. In this place, we will discuss and try to expose it to bring about change.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo other survivors spoke at the meeting on condition of anonymity.\r\n\r\nOne testified that a cousin trafficked her beginning at age 11. \u201cAt 14, he took me to sadistic clubs. I endured torture and starvation at the hands of well-known and prominent individuals. I suffered harm in endless ways.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were public events, and there were internal ceremonies where I was tied to a tall post with handcuffs. Around me, there were other handcuffed victims with rituals of drinking menstrual blood and the slaughter of cats and other animals. They told me no one would believe me if I spoke out.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe continued that she filed a complaint with the police five years ago. \u201cThe prosecution closed the case due to lack of evidence, so I appealed, and it was accepted. I came to testify while on pregnancy bed rest, but the case was closed again due to lack of evidence.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey said I was imagining things. I presented a recorded testimony from someone who admitted to harming me, but she was never summoned for questioning. Treat this as terrorism.\u201d\r\n\r\nhttps://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-856407", "author": "Cuetardian", "created": 1750253980468, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Valiazaner", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "", "removal_source": "", "link": "", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Massive Scandal in Israel, with War to Cover Up the Story.

It seems that testimony really did happen.</p>\n<p>The Iranian hack story (if true) has not been covered by western press, AFAIK.</p>\n<p>Here is the entire article from the Jerusalem Post:</p>\n<p>Survivors testify: MKs participated in sadistic sexual 'rituals' involving minors</p>\n<p>\u2018Doctors, educators, police officers, and past and present members of the Knesset were involved in these abuses,\u2019 survivor says.</p>\n<p>(Warning: The following contains sensitive material, reader discretion is advised.)</p>\n<p>Several women on Tuesday testified in the Knesset about sexual abuse they suffered as minors as part of religious ritual ceremonies.</p>\n<p>The testimonies came during a joint meeting of the Knesset\u2019s Committee on the Status of Women and Gender Equality, chaired by MK Pnina Tameno-Shete (National Unity), and the Special Committee on Young Israelis, chaired by MK Naama Lazimi (The Democrats).</p>\n<p>The joint meeting was organized in the wake of an investigative report published on April 2 by Israel Hayom journalist Noam Barkan.</p>\n<p>Yael Ariel, one of the abuse survivors, shared: \u201cI experienced ritual abuse over many years until my late teens and was forced to harm other children. I chose to speak out and make my voice heard. I received threats after revealing my story. From age five to age 20, I was harmed in these ceremonies.\u201d</p>\n<p>According to Ariel, she received testimonies from several women who claimed that doctors, educators, police officers, and past and present members of the Knesset were involved in these abuses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI filed a complaint with the police that was closed after a few months, and I know of other cases that were closed. Speaking out today in the Knesset is a historic moment,\u201d she said.</p>\n<p>Another survivor, Yael Shitrit, testified: \u201cYou have no idea what ritual abuse is. The human brain cannot comprehend it. You can\u2019t imagine what it means to program a three-year-old girl through rape and sadism so they can do whatever they want without anyone knowing.</p>\n<p>\u201cTheir trafficking of me happened all over the country. They moved me from ceremony to ceremony. Naked men stood in a circle. My therapist, her husband, and her son harmed me, and there were dozens of other girls and boys who harmed me.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were ceremonies and rituals meant to make me forget,\u201d Shitrit continued. \u201cThe police have known about this for a year, but they don\u2019t have the tools to deal with it.</p>\n<p>The people who will fall are very, very senior figures. These people run communities and government agencies. They threaten us. I have children I need to protect. Something needs to be set up that can deal with this.</p>\n<p>They tried to make us like them \u2013 the people who caused us endless pain,\u201d Shitrit said. \u201cYour role is to make this stop in Safed, Jerusalem, Jaljulya, or anywhere else,\u201d she declared.</p>\n<p>DR. NAAMA GOLDBERG, head of an NGO called Lo Omdot MeNegged (Hebrew for \u201cNot Standing Idly By\u201d), which assists prostitution survivors, explained that the depictions are sometimes so gruesome that they are hard to believe, but this incredulity serves the abusers, who convince victims not to complain by arguing that they will not be believed.</p>\n<p>\u201cSeveral years ago, I received descriptions of sadistic abuse of children,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThe accounts sounded absurd. [But] the testimonies kept coming and would not let up. They described gang rape by men, and sometimes by women. The abuse was filmed, and drugs were used. There were ritual practices and symbolism.</p>\n<p>\u201cI presented the police with written testimonies from five women. To this day, no one has contacted me. Since the report, additional testimonies have surfaced,\u201d Goldberg said.</p>\n<p>A representative of the Israel Police, Ch.-Supt. Anat Yakir, said that there was a national unit reviewing all cases and that the complaints were \u201ca top priority in the intelligence division.\u201d</p>\n<p>These testimonies are a 'watershed moment'</p>\n<p>MKs who attended the meeting were visibly shaken by some of the testimonies, with one calling it a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and another calling the revelations \u201ctitanic.\u201d</p>\n<p>Tameno-Shete said, \u201cReality shows us that the police are not strong in handling sexual offenses. No one wants to talk about brutal rape and children being raped. There are unimaginable cases of monstrosity here.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lazimi added, \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe when I heard about a network of ritual abuse against girls and the fact that there is an organized and dangerous mechanism and nothing is being done to stop it. In this place, we will discuss and try to expose it to bring about change.\u201d</p>\n<p>Two other survivors spoke at the meeting on condition of anonymity.</p>\n<p>One testified that a cousin trafficked her beginning at age 11. \u201cAt 14, he took me to sadistic clubs. I endured torture and starvation at the hands of well-known and prominent individuals. I suffered harm in endless ways.</p>\n<p>\u201cThere were public events, and there were internal ceremonies where I was tied to a tall post with handcuffs. Around me, there were other handcuffed victims with rituals of drinking menstrual blood and the slaughter of cats and other animals. They told me no one would believe me if I spoke out.\u201d</p>\n<p>She continued that she filed a complaint with the police five years ago. \u201cThe prosecution closed the case due to lack of evidence, so I appealed, and it was accepted. I came to testify while on pregnancy bed rest, but the case was closed again due to lack of evidence.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey said I was imagining things. I presented a recorded testimony from someone who admitted to harming me, but she was never summoned for questioning. Treat this as terrorism.\u201d</p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-856407\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-856407</a></p>\n", "score_down": 6, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": true, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 57, "score_up": 254, "is_edited": false, "is_moderator": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "archive_id": ""}], "status": true}
