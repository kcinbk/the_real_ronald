The Problem Plainly Stated \n\nMost Americans still assume they live in the country created between 1776 and 1789. In reality, many of the defining features of that country have already been hollowed out\u2014not by force of arms, but by a deliberate, decades-long redefinition of what it means to be an American citizen.\nOld understanding (1776\u20131789):\nAn American citizen is a member of a specific, self-governing people who instituted a limited government for the sole purpose of securing pre-existing natural rights. When that government becomes destructive of those ends, the people retain the right\u2014and, in the final resort, the duty\u2014to alter or abolish it.\n\nNew understanding (now being installed):\nA person residing within the geographic United States is primarily a \u201cglobal citizen\u201d whose rights and duties are defined by transnational institutions, expert consensus, and \u201cplanetary\u201d challenges. National identity is presented as parochial, even dangerous.\n\nThis is not speculation. It is written into policy, curriculum, and law.\n\nII. Stage One: Make the Founders Morally Untouchable\n\nSince roughly 2019 the campaign to strip the Founding generation of legitimacy has moved from academic journals into elementary classrooms, state standards, and government training materials.\n\nConcrete examples, 2020\u20132025:\n\nMore than 140 public schools and public buildings named for Washington, Jefferson, Madison, or Franklin have been renamed. In most cases the new names honor contemporary activists with no connection to the American experiment.\n\nThe College Board\u2019s 2023\u20132025 AP U.S. History framework requires the Founding to be taught as one of several \u201ccompeting narratives,\u201d with mandatory inclusion of the claim that 1619, not 1776, is the nation\u2019s true founding moment.\nCalifornia\u2019s 2024 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum\u2014now required for high-school graduation\u2014frames the traditional American story as a \u201cdominant narrative\u201d that must be countered through \u201cresistance\u201d and \u201cdecolonization.\u201d\nAt least nineteen states have incorporated elements of the 1619 Project or similar frameworks into K-12 social-studies standards.\n\nThe purpose is not balance; it is disqualification. When children learn that the authors of the Declaration and Constitution were irredeemably flawed oppressors, the principles they articulated lose their power to command respect\u2014or to limit government.\n\nIII. Stage Two: Replace the Citizen with the \u201cGlobal Citizen\u201d\n\nSimultaneously, federal agencies, public universities, and major school districts have adopted language and programs that redefine allegiance.\n\nSelected public documents still in force in 2025:\n\nU.S. Department of State 2024\u20132028 Strategic Plan: repeatedly describes U.S. interests as inseparable from \u201cglobal challenges that transcend national borders.\u201d\nU.S. Department of Education 2023 Equity Action Plan: commits to preparing students for an \u201cinterconnected world\u201d using the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as the organizing framework.\nUNESCO\u2019s \u201cEducation for Global Citizenship\u201d modules, distributed to 41 states through domestic partnerships since 2021.\nThe 2022 National Security Strategy and its 2025 updates use the phrase \u201cglobal commons\u201d dozens of times while discussing national sovereignty only as something that must be \u201cbalanced\u201d against international obligations.\n\nPractical consequences are already visible: record illegal border crossings are officially described as \u201cirregular migration\u201d to be \u201cmanaged,\u201d not stopped; courts increasingly cite unratified treaties; taxpayer data flows automatically to OECD \u201cglobal transparency\u201d programs.\n\nIV. The Direct Connection\n\nIncome tax, mass surveillance, and open borders appear unrelated only at first glance.\n\nUnlimited direct taxation (16th Amendment + automatic withholding) funds institutions\u2014UN agencies, IMF, WHO, NGOs\u2014that no American voter can remove from office.\n\nWarrantless bulk collection and AI-enhanced monitoring (Section 702 FISA, EO 12333, 2025 executive expansions) treat every citizen as a potential risk to \u201cglobal stability\u201d rather than a rights-bearing sovereign.\nThe administrative erasure of the citizen/non-citizen distinction dilutes the political weight of the only group that still possesses, on paper, the constitutional authority to revoke consent.\n\nNone of these innovations could survive a population that still took seriously Madison\u2019s warning that power is \u201cof an encroaching nature\u201d or Jefferson\u2019s declaration that the people retain the right to alter or abolish destructive government. That belief can only be neutralized by first making the Founders themselves morally radioactive, then teaching children that their primary identity is planetary, not American.\n\nV. A Development Few Have Noticed\n\nIn June 2025 the Department of Education issued guidance permitting federally funded universities to grant admissions and financial-aid preferences to applicants who complete approved \u201cGlobal Citizenship and Sustainability\u201d certificates. Within four months, twelve flagship state universities adopted the policy. For the first time in American history, the federal government is explicitly rewarding the rejection of exclusive national citizenship with tangible educational and economic benefits.\n\nVI. What This Means\n\nThis is not yet a call to arms. The Founders spent twelve exhausting years (1764\u20131776) trying every peaceful remedy before they concluded that independence was the only option left. We have not reached that point.\nIt is, however, a call to unflinching clarity.\nSo long as a critical mass of Americans remembers three simple truths:\nThe Constitution remains the supreme law of the land,  \n\nRights come from our Creator and are secured by our government, not granted by the UN or five justices,  \nThe people of the United States\u2014not \u201cthe international community\u201d\u2014remain the ultimate sovereign,\n\nthen lawful recovery is still possible through elections, state action, litigation, Article V conventions, and simple, widespread refusal to comply with illegitimate decrees.\nBut the moment the living memory of 1776 and 1787 is successfully extinguished, the republic becomes unrecoverable by any means short of the one the Founders themselves were finally forced to employ.\nThe tools are still in our hands.\nThe question is whether we will use them before the knowledge that makes them meaningful disappears forever.", "author": "covfefe_energy", "created": 1764333813582, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Goobillypoo", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "", "removal_source": "", "link": "", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "The Deliberate Erasure of American Existence", "last_comment_created": 1764339611545, "content": "<p>I.
