Embodying how the WORST aspects of the pro-H1B side could exist in one brain, not on the internet, but in the real government officials that expected to rule us.</p>\n<p>What was wrong with Viveks tweet? Well, to start it sought to blame Americans for what was done to them by their government. It was also supremely condescending and tone-def. But more to the point, Vivek\u2019s words were impossible to divorce from the anti-White racial angle of the rest of the discourse on HB1s, not least because HE BROUGHT RACE into it. There was even the sort of pseudo-sexual racial contempt in Vivek\u2019s statement, a bitterness against the white football stars who got the prom Queen. The jokes wrote themselves.</p>\n<p>But it got worse. Because substantively, even the steelman of Vivek\u2019s ideas were Hogwash. At its height, Western countries always had leaders with BOTH the qualities of the sportsman and the nerd, the warrior scholar was always the Faustian ideal. America had only arrived at the idea of the \u201cNerd King\u201d lately, the focus on intellectual specialization directly corresponding to its decline. The idea that the key to success was just to grind tech knowledge harder and go full \u201ctiger mother\u201d with American kids is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>After all, that\u2019s what South Korea does. How is it working out for them?</p>\n<p>The Vivek discourse put the cherry on top of the H1B discourse, cementing the humiliation permanently and hopefully waking Americans out of a good deal of Boomer delusions.</p>\n<p>Red-pilling never fully takes for normies. But if there is anything I hope we can learn from this, it\u2019s that all politics is collective, and that you shouldn\u2019t trust sycophants who just try to simp for the \u201cwinning side\u201d because after everything is said and done you just look like an idiot.</p>\n<p>A fitting end for the \u201cElite Human Capital\u201d people.</p>\n<p>x.com/VivekGRamaswam\u2026&quot;</p>\n", "score_down": 6, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 165, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "hat", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "id": 7366674, "raw_content": "\"Dave Greene\n@GreeneMan6\nDec 28 \u2022 2 tweets \u2022 5 min read \u2022  Read on X https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1873070019757916633.html\n\nThe H1B debate is one of the most fascinating pieces of discourse in 2024, a humiliating defeat for the Musk, tech bros, and \u201cElite Human Capital\u201d.\n\nBut how did this happen?

Whereas the white liberal defenders of H1B wanted to status-shame middle America for being racists and not sufficiently \u201ccolor blind\u201d, the other hand, the Indian defenders of H1B wanted status shame middle America for\u2026well \u2026being white. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t work.\n\nPlatitudes about how we needed to welcome \u201cThe Huddled masses yearning to work free in our struggling multinationals\u201d, didn\u2019t feel particularly appealing when it was buttressed by hundreds of Indians screaming about how whites were inferior and deserved to be conquered and replaced.\n\nSo the conversation sounds like this:\n\nDoe-eyed Boomer liberal: \u201cGee guys, we can\u2019t be WACIST\u201d\nSome Bizarre Brown Mutant: \u201cWe are the MASTER RACE and we will CRUSH YOU, SAR!\u201d\n\nOk, fine. Maybe this was just a lesson in how the internet was crazy? It might have been had Mr. Ramaswamy not intervened with one of the worst tweets of all time. Embodying how the WORST aspects of the pro-H1B side could exist in one brain, not on the internet, but in the real government officials that expected to rule us.\n\nWhat was wrong with Viveks tweet? Well, to start it sought to blame Americans for what was done to them by their government. It was also supremely condescending and tone-def. But more to the point, Vivek\u2019s words were impossible to divorce from the anti-White racial angle of the rest of the discourse on HB1s, not least because HE BROUGHT RACE into it. There was even the sort of pseudo-sexual racial contempt in Vivek\u2019s statement, a bitterness against the white football stars who got the prom Queen. The jokes wrote themselves.\n\nBut it got worse. Because substantively, even the steelman of Vivek\u2019s ideas were Hogwash. At its height, Western countries always had leaders with BOTH the qualities of the sportsman and the nerd, the warrior scholar was always the Faustian ideal. America had only arrived at the idea of the \u201cNerd King\u201d lately, the focus on intellectual specialization directly corresponding to its decline. The idea that the key to success was just to grind tech knowledge harder and go full \u201ctiger mother\u201d with American kids is ridiculous.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s what South Korea does. How is it working out for them?\n\nThe Vivek discourse put the cherry on top of the H1B discourse, cementing the humiliation permanently and hopefully waking Americans out of a good deal of Boomer delusions.\n\nRed-pilling never fully takes for normies. But if there is anything I hope we can learn from this, it\u2019s that all politics is collective, and that you shouldn\u2019t trust sycophants who just try to simp for the \u201cwinning side\u201d because after everything is said and done you just look like an idiot.\n\nA fitting end for the \u201cElite Human Capital\u201d people.\n\nx.com/VivekGRamaswam\u2026\"\n", "comments": 16, "author": "Lunar", "created": 1736078566202, "score_up": 171, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Helicopter_Rides", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "SAVE AMERICA", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.scored.co/preview/19A1CDJS7O.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://media.scored.co/post/Tl47c9Nu6BEj.jpeg", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [{"reference": "/scale/zPehyuxNRJODo5fb.jpeg", "width": 640, "content-type": "jpeg", "height": 342}], "blurhash": "UJKbUh3CVY5j|=AVw[%0BVxDou$$z;AWxE%1", "full_resolution": [342, 640]}, "title": "One of the best upgrades from the first term", "type": "link", "last_comment_created": 1736090938224, "uuid": "19A1CDJS7O", "content": "", "score_down": 3, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 1529, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": true, "id": 7365782, "raw_content": "", "comments": 137, "author": "alanocu", "created": 1736034001690, "score_up": 1532, "profile_picture": "vf1ZFHH0miUS", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "non_gmo_humon", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "media.scored.co", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/02/25/2015-04042/employment-authorization-for-certain-h-4-dependent-spouses", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "H4-Employment Authorization (Obama) let the spouses of H1Bz work.
