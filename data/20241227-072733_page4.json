But at the present moment to &quot;America first&quot; naturalized immigrants behind the helm of Doge, are calling Americans retarded and calling for more immigration from shit hole countries.  They seem to recognize this administrative state as one of the most powerful branches of government.</p>\n<p>It is quite possible that Doge will target not just junk organization as to create a forest, while also cutting down some specific trees of highly qualified government officials.  Positions that will likely need to be filled again &quot;out of necessity&quot;, or will likely come back because of a general understanding of the &quot;dynamics&quot; of systems.</p>\n<p>The Talent that is gone, but to be restored, are prime to be replaced, maybe not in the Trump administration but the administration that follows, by foreigners.</p>\n<p>What this translates to is that the future of the American administrative state may be occupied by &quot;highly skilled&quot; Indian immigrants; whites need not apply, as per always.  Do you hear me, our powerful administration state and our institutions may be controlled by foreign actors who have been invited in exploiting an attack vector of recognizing the need to shrink our bloated and corrupt  government.</p>\n<p>There is also another thing about dynamics.  if you are able to obtain a population of but 13% of a fixed belief, and about an 87% of the population with a mixed belief, that over numerous social interactions, that what started as a minority fixed belief will be have plurality.  With a very small population, a hostile foreign actor can change the policy in democratic institutions if they immigrate people in of a like mind.  See marvel et al.</p>\n<p>The dynamics of systems is also very important to consider what is happening to our own techworkers.  The science of ecology, heavily occupied by the communist left out of environmentalism, have a principle called competitive exclusion.  That when two species are competing for the same resources, that one will drive the other to extinction.  We are seeing this already in tech, as white male grads can't even get a job and all the jobs are going to foreigners.  See Lotka-Volterra equations,</p>\n<p>This is also what is going on to our birth rates as well. Civilized people, for thousands of years, have had standards on how they want to raise kids. In contrast. Foreigners tend to grow up in the slums, so they have a greater capacity to have kids where civilized people would recognize that they can't and that it would be irresponsible to do so. Certainly we seen this in europe with ads convincing white people not to have kids to save the planet, while encouraging minorities to have kids.  That somehow a Womans beach body is bad, only to be replaced with healthy at any size.  American already has an obesity crisis, so why bother being healthy, happy, and desirable. Outside of a fetish, does anyone really want to have kids with a land whale (male or female), and what is the life expectancy of this &quot;healthy at any size&quot; land whale?  Something wants people of European decent erased from the face of the earth.</p>\n<p>Vivek in calling all Americans retarded, highlighted the media culture in the 1990s that tended to push jocks and cheerleaders. Not to forget, some of the TV girls (winnie cooper, blossum) back then went on to become mathematicians and neuroscientists in their real life studies.  Anyways, not everyone was a jock or a cheerleader;  there were nerds and couldn't escape their caste (which has also been pounded in the media too), see for example the grim advenures of billy and mandy regarding irwin, south park, &quot;the list&quot;, Nerds were being forcefully and heavily bullied, made fun of, and ostracized everywhere in the media.  They weren't being pushed to become a jock as Vivek avers-although maybe today the males are being pushed to become female cheerleaders by the groomers. This was to apply extra stress on nerdy people to make them useful tools for society with zero distractions, but also ensure that they were removed from the gene pool. In horticulture stressing plants is often done to cause them to produce a higher yield as a final reproductive effort. The narrative Vivek was trying to sell the public is not in fact true, the truth is american coders had to work harder to try to achieve the basic human needs that were intentionally deprived to him (being able to interact with others, ending loneliness, more specifically logos or claiming his basic humanity through acceptance of a woman).  Ostracism is very painful <em>for evolutionary reasons</em>, and even the mighty tiger is expect to die quickly when excluded from a pack.  So they were motivated to end this loneliness, that (inability to interact with others, impairs social development, etc) which has become part of the DSM-V diagnotic for autistic spectrum disorders.  However this stress model of obtaining higher yeilds wasn't perfect.

But at the present moment to \"America first\" naturalized immigrants behind the helm of Doge, are calling Americans retarded and calling for more immigration from shit hole countries.  They seem to recognize this administrative state as one of the most powerful branches of government.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that Doge will target not just junk organization as to create a forest, while also cutting down some specific trees of highly qualified government officials.  Positions that will likely need to be filled again \"out of necessity\", or will likely come back because of a general understanding of the \"dynamics\" of systems.\r\n\r\nThe Talent that is gone, but to be restored, are prime to be replaced, maybe not in the Trump administration but the administration that follows, by foreigners.\r\n\r\nWhat this translates to is that the future of the American administrative state may be occupied by \"highly skilled\" Indian immigrants; whites need not apply, as per always.  Do you hear me, our powerful administration state and our institutions may be controlled by foreign actors who have been invited in exploiting an attack vector of recognizing the need to shrink our bloated and corrupt  government.\r\n\r\nThere is also another thing about dynamics.  if you are able to obtain a population of but 13% of a fixed belief, and about an 87% of the population with a mixed belief, that over numerous social interactions, that what started as a minority fixed belief will be have plurality.  With a very small population, a hostile foreign actor can change the policy in democratic institutions if they immigrate people in of a like mind.  See marvel et al.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of systems is also very important to consider what is happening to our own techworkers.  The science of ecology, heavily occupied by the communist left out of environmentalism, have a principle called competitive exclusion.  That when two species are competing for the same resources, that one will drive the other to extinction.  We are seeing this already in tech, as white male grads can't even get a job and all the jobs are going to foreigners.  See Lotka-Volterra equations,\r\n\r\n  This is also what is going on to our birth rates as well. Civilized people, for thousands of years, have had standards on how they want to raise kids. In contrast. Foreigners tend to grow up in the slums, so they have a greater capacity to have kids where civilized people would recognize that they can't and that it would be irresponsible to do so. Certainly we seen this in europe with ads convincing white people not to have kids to save the planet, while encouraging minorities to have kids.  That somehow a Womans beach body is bad, only to be replaced with healthy at any size.  American already has an obesity crisis, so why bother being healthy, happy, and desirable. Outside of a fetish, does anyone really want to have kids with a land whale (male or female), and what is the life expectancy of this \"healthy at any size\" land whale?  Something wants people of European decent erased from the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nVivek in calling all Americans retarded, highlighted the media culture in the 1990s that tended to push jocks and cheerleaders. Not to forget, some of the TV girls (winnie cooper, blossum) back then went on to become mathematicians and neuroscientists in their real life studies.  Anyways, not everyone was a jock or a cheerleader;  there were nerds and couldn't escape their caste (which has also been pounded in the media too), see for example the grim advenures of billy and mandy regarding irwin, south park, \"the list\", Nerds were being forcefully and heavily bullied, made fun of, and ostracized everywhere in the media.  They weren't being pushed to become a jock as Vivek avers-although maybe today the males are being pushed to become female cheerleaders by the groomers. This was to apply extra stress on nerdy people to make them useful tools for society with zero distractions, but also ensure that they were removed from the gene pool. In horticulture stressing plants is often done to cause them to produce a higher yield as a final reproductive effort. The narrative Vivek was trying to sell the public is not in fact true, the truth is american coders had to work harder to try to achieve the basic human needs that were intentionally deprived to him (being able to interact with others, ending loneliness, more specifically logos or claiming his basic humanity through acceptance of a woman).  Ostracism is very painful *for evolutionary reasons*, and even the mighty tiger is expect to die quickly when excluded from a pack.  So they were motivated to end this loneliness, that (inability to interact with others, impairs social development, etc) which has become part of the DSM-V diagnotic for autistic spectrum disorders.  However this stress model of obtaining higher yeilds wasn't perfect.  Some may have burned up in the process and quit, \"die\", others with the mix of ssris (or possibly schizophrenia in teddy's case) have gone violently insane, and others went with the flow.
