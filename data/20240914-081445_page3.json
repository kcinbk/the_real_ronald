Enjoy!</p>\n<p><strong>Springfield, Ohio Migrant issue IS NOT FAKE NEWS.</strong></p>\n<p>By  James, Empty Pockets Garage</p>\n<p>Hey everybody!  This is James, [with] Empty Pocket's Garage.  I wanted to make a quick video to address something that's made it - it looks like it's made National and International news about the Haitian migrants that have been thrust upon us here in Springfield, Ohio, and that is where I live.</p>\n<p>And I just wanted to address the issue a little bit because I've seen a lot of stuff on National news and a lot of YouTube content creators weighing in on this situation.</p>\n<p>And I've even seen where they've uh - because for whatever reason - some news outlets are showing videos that are really not from here or have anything to do with the Haitian migrants here, or about what they do.</p>\n<p>So, it kind of irritates me that they're [doing this] \u2018cause this is a small town so there's not like a bunch of videos that people like,  stop with their phones and start recording stuff when they see it -  it's it's just not that kind of a place.</p>\n<p>So, there isn't a whole lot of video evidence of the stuff [that is] happening and the fact that some news outlets are using videos that have nothing to do with this town,  and then everybody's saying well this is a \u2018Nothing Burger\u2019 [or] \u2018It's Fake News\u2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Well, I am a resident of Springfield, Ohio and IT IS NOT fake news.</strong></p>\n<p>There is an issue with [the Haitians], \u2018cause we have in our local park\u2026..  ducks down there that the park takes care of and it's it's where they live.  <strong>And they are being killed and eaten [by the Haitians].</strong></p>\n<p>And, as far as people's personal pets,  I've heard stories but I can't answer to that personally \u2018cause I don't know.  But, I can tell you  \u2018cause this is a Car Channel. I do Car Content.  [So,] I can approach this story from the car [angle].</p>\n<p>When I say that, I mean the driving issues.  They - and I've witnessed this.  They literally -  (and they have to have a translator wherever they go) -  they literally have been in the DMV where I go, and get my license plates renewed, and it's also where you get your license obviously,  and they literally have a translator, and they show up with a piece of paperwork that grants them driving privileges with no proof that they can actually drive.</p>\n<p>Just,  that they're of age.  [It] gives them driving privileges for 45 days.\nAnd then in 45 days,  they can go back and renew it.  And, they never have to show proof of \u2026 how competent of a driver they are!</p>\n<p>We can't do that!  And, <strong>the accidents that are happening here in this town, are crazy!</strong></p>\n<p>[The stories!] And like I said, I've witnessed some of this,  so I'm approaching this from a car aspect.  Uh, <strong>they can't drive!</strong>   I don't know where they -  how they - are even able to do this legally in this country.   But uh, <strong>they've hit trees, fire hydrants, people\u2026 I mean there's been fatalities from them not really knowing how to drive.</strong></p>\n<p>And, as far as some of the stories where I've seen where,  (and even somebody called this old lady a \u2018Karen\u2019 because she was complaining about the rudeness of them), just heard tryin\u2019 to go to the grocery store\u2026 Well,  it is a fact!  Uh, <strong>they are some rude individuals,  and I mean rude!</strong></p>\n<p>I actually had some live across the street from me for a while, in a two-bedroom house there must have been a dozen of them living there.  And, they have a - they get transported around -  [by] some Haitians,  some of the ones that I've actually been in conversation with [are] the ones that are driving, [who] can comprehend the English language a little bit.</p>\n<p>But, the ones that are driving the vans that go around and pick the [others] up  - they have their own little network of getting people around that don't have a car \u2013 [by] transporting them all over.</p>\n<p><strong>And they literally pull up and they lay on their horn and I don't mean for like \u2018beep, beep\u2019.   I mean sometimes 5 minutes straight \u2018EEEE\u2019  \u2018EEEE\u2019, \u2018EEEE\u2019 to where I've literally had to go out, and go up to the dude and tell him to shut the mother fuckin\u2019 van off,  get your ass out of the van, go up to the goddamn door and fuckin\u2019 knock on it!  Nobody wants to hear this horn blow over and over and over again!</strong></p>\n<p>And, I thought there was going to be a fight right then and there, until he realized that I am an open carry person, so it kind of deescalated the conversation real quick.</p>\n<p>And from that point, he did, going forward, get out of his van and go up and knock on the door.   <strong>So, I'm saying they are rude to the point to where it's like they test people to see what they can get away with</strong>.   And this is a small town -  20,000 people - and this is a poor County, this is not a a high-end wealthy County <strong>and for them to uh come in and get preference - and I mean preference\u2026</strong></p>\n<p>I'll give you one example and then I'm gonna get off here.   I have a brother who is disabled and he was uh, he's in a low income apartment complex and they were building new homes or I [guess they are] attached to one another, they're not like apartments uh they're all single floor\u2026 \u2018cause  he can't get up and down stairs, so he has to have a single floor deal, uh with a little mobile scooter and stuff.  But anyways,  he had been on this waiting list for this new Housing Development for uh low income and disabled people.  And he checks periodically [to] see where he's at on the list because they'll tell you, you know, you got so many people ahead of you\u2026 And, he pretty much knew where he was on the list.  And he was getting close [to the top].  This last time he called and checked on it [and] they gave him a number and he's like, \u201cWell, that's not where I was before.  It looks like I went backwards on the list. Why?\u201d  <strong>Well, I guess the Haitians for whatever reason, for whatever political umbrella they are here under, got pushed to the front of the line.</strong></p>\n<p>So now my brother has to wait even longer because of the Haitians.  And they're not disabled, <strong>they're getting special preference for housing that really should be uh, I really hate to sound [entitled],  but it should be for US citizens first!</strong>  And then like, they can go and move into the apartment complex that my brother's trying to get out of because there's a bunch of young people there - single mothers, a lot of children, he gets nervous around all that you know, so he wants to be in a safer environment for himself and this place was going to be \u2018it\u2019.  Well, now it's not looking like it's going to be \u2018it\u2019 anytime in the near future.   <strong>And that kind of bothers me.  I'm not going to say a little bit, I'm going to say a lot!</strong></p>\n<p>But, so, IT'S NOT FAKE NEWS.  There are [real] cases of what they are saying on the news.  It is true [but] there's probably not a lot of video evidence [to prove it].  There is some,  and I can only speak to what I have witnessed personally.  I cannot speak to all of it.</p>\n<p>But it is bad enough that it concerns a lot of people in this town, and I'm one of them! Because I'm up in age and I'm disabled myself,  so I worry that - they are - like I said,  they are rude, rude people.  And I could see them growing in numbers like in an apartment complex and [then] try to rule over the area.  And nobody will do anything about it.  It's, you know like, if I went to a foreign country, and I decided I wanted to live there, I would be expected to know the laws and the \u2018rules of engagement\u2019 with everything.  And if I get in trouble there for doing something that is against the law there (but not against the law where I'm from) [I can\u2019t expect not to] get in trouble.  That's just asinine.  So but right now there's no accountability.</p>\n<p>In our local government these people suck ass.  They always have.  I mean they are just -  you know how politicians are?  It\u2019s just crazy.  And I didn't mean for this to get to be this long, but I just wanted to say [this]:</p>\n<p><strong>I am a Springfield, Ohio resident.  These stories for the most part I can verify personally ARE TRUE this is NOT FAKE NEWS.  And for the people that say that?  Fuck you.  You come and take a tour in our town and see if it ain't true!</strong></p>\n<p>So, I've seen where [we\u2019ve] made National, International [news] uh a lot of YouTube content creators are, like I said,  most of them are just reporting it as they take it off of a news outlet,  but some of them are digging deep and saying, \u201cWow this is fake news.\u201d And, \u201cThis video ain't from there -  that video is not from there\u2026\u201d - and they're right.  They're not.  And it pisses me off.  The news outlets that use those stupid videos that have nothing to do with our town [and minimizes what truly IS HAPPENING to our town].</p>\n<p>So, anyways I didn't mean to ramble on.</p>\n<p>I just wanted to put that out there.  So my next video will be back to \u2018Car Content\u2019.</p>\n<p>But until then,  this is James, Empty Pockets Garage.  I'm out of here.</p>\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZADwzk5D2U\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZADwzk5D2U</a></p>\n", "score_down": 0, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 54, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "id": 7038482, "raw_content": "Below is a transcription I made from his video.

And, they have a - they get transported around -  [by] some Haitians,  some of the ones that I've actually been in conversation with [are] the ones that are driving, [who] can comprehend the English language a little bit.   \n\nBut, the ones that are driving the vans that go around and pick the [others] up  - they have their own little network of getting people around that don't have a car \u2013 [by] transporting them all over.  \n\n**And they literally pull up and they lay on their horn and I don't mean for like \u2018beep, beep\u2019.   I mean sometimes 5 minutes straight \u2018EEEE\u2019  \u2018EEEE\u2019, \u2018EEEE\u2019 to where I've literally had to go out, and go up to the dude and tell him to shut the mother fuckin\u2019 van off,  get your ass out of the van, go up to the goddamn door and fuckin\u2019 knock on it!  Nobody wants to hear this horn blow over and over and over again!** \n\nAnd, I thought there was going to be a fight right then and there, until he realized that I am an open carry person, so it kind of deescalated the conversation real quick. \n\nAnd from that point, he did, going forward, get out of his van and go up and knock on the door.   **So, I'm saying they are rude to the point to where it's like they test people to see what they can get away with**.   And this is a small town -  20,000 people - and this is a poor County, this is not a a high-end wealthy County **and for them to uh come in and get preference - and I mean preference\u2026**\n\nI'll give you one example and then I'm gonna get off here.   I have a brother who is disabled and he was uh, he's in a low income apartment complex and they were building new homes or I [guess they are] attached to one another, they're not like apartments uh they're all single floor\u2026 \u2018cause  he can't get up and down stairs, so he has to have a single floor deal, uh with a little mobile scooter and stuff.  But anyways,  he had been on this waiting list for this new Housing Development for uh low income and disabled people.  And he checks periodically [to] see where he's at on the list because they'll tell you, you know, you got so many people ahead of you\u2026 And, he pretty much knew where he was on the list.  And he was getting close [to the top].  This last time he called and checked on it [and] they gave him a number and he's like, \u201cWell, that's not where I was before.  It looks like I went backwards on the list. Why?\u201d  **Well, I guess the Haitians for whatever reason, for whatever political umbrella they are here under, got pushed to the front of the line.**  \n\nSo now my brother has to wait even longer because of the Haitians.  And they're not disabled, **they're getting special preference for housing that really should be uh, I really hate to sound [entitled],  but it should be for US citizens first!**  And then like, they can go and move into the apartment complex that my brother's trying to get out of because there's a bunch of young people there - single mothers, a lot of children, he gets nervous around all that you know, so he wants to be in a safer environment for himself and this place was going to be \u2018it\u2019.  Well, now it's not looking like it's going to be \u2018it\u2019 anytime in the near future.   **And that kind of bothers me.  I'm not going to say a little bit, I'm going to say a lot!**    \n\nBut, so, IT'S NOT FAKE NEWS.  There are [real] cases of what they are saying on the news.  It is true [but] there's probably not a lot of video evidence [to prove it].  There is some,  and I can only speak to what I have witnessed personally.  I cannot speak to all of it.\n\nBut it is bad enough that it concerns a lot of people in this town, and I'm one of them! Because I'm up in age and I'm disabled myself,  so I worry that - they are - like I said,  they are rude, rude people.  And I could see them growing in numbers like in an apartment complex and [then] try to rule over the area.  And nobody will do anything about it.  It's, you know like, if I went to a foreign country, and I decided I wanted to live there, I would be expected to know the laws and the \u2018rules of engagement\u2019 with everything.  And if I get in trouble there for doing something that is against the law there (but not against the law where I'm from) [I can\u2019t expect not to] get in trouble.  That's just asinine.  So but right now there's no accountability. \n\nIn our local government these people suck ass.  They always have.  I mean they are just -  you know how politicians are?  It\u2019s just crazy.  And I didn't mean for this to get to be this long, but I just wanted to say [this]: \n\n**I am a Springfield, Ohio resident.  These stories for the most part I can verify personally ARE TRUE this is NOT FAKE NEWS.  And for the people that say that?  Fuck you.  You come and take a tour in our town and see if it ain't true!** \n\nSo, I've seen where [we\u2019ve] made National, International [news] uh a lot of YouTube content creators are, like I said,  most of them are just reporting it as they take it off of a news outlet,  but some of them are digging deep and saying, \u201cWow this is fake news.\u201d And, \u201cThis video ain't from there -  that video is not from there\u2026\u201d - and they're right.  They're not.  And it pisses me off.  The news outlets that use those stupid videos that have nothing to do with our town [and minimizes what truly IS HAPPENING to our town].\n\nSo, anyways I didn't mean to ramble on. \n\nI just wanted to put that out there.  So my next video will be back to \u2018Car Content\u2019. \n\nBut until then,  this is James, Empty Pockets Garage.  I'm out of here.\n\n**Source:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZADwzk5D2U ", "comments": 3, "author": "CasuallyObservant", "created": 1726304530527, "score_up": 54, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "CasuallyObservant", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.patriots.win/preview/1994tho8UC.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://media.patriots.win/post/TjUrOFtVe8iF.jpeg", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [{"reference": "/scale/3W8KGMEyTO5ZrJY9.jpeg", "width": 536, "content-type": "jpeg", "height": 768}], "blurhash": "UeI;-aofD*jF_NWBxuay.9WVoLWV?bayV@of", "full_resolution": [836, 584]}, "title": "Kamala Kats", "type": "link", "last_comment_created": 1726314035347, "uuid": "1994tho8UC", "content": "", "score_down": 0, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 41, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": true, "id": 7038570, "raw_content": "", "comments": 2, "author": "Freedom_Feels_Good", "created": 1726310159844, "score_up": 41, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "diogenesofthearch", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "media.patriots.win", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.patriots.win/preview/1994tgeut6.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://media.scored.co/post/vglkVgq24RlC.png", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [{"reference": "/scale/42u9t4Y93sQVWIUS.png", "width": 460, "content-type": "png", "height": 394}], "blurhash": "U45#eM%3?b%2_4aM?HxaxbM{xaoLWAWAM{Rj", "full_resolution": [394, 460]}, "title": "Let them fight ", "type": "link", "last_comment_created": 1726314705949, "uuid": "1994tgeut6", "content": "", "score_down": 18, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 441, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "cat", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": true, "id": 7037288, "raw_content": "", "comments": 33, "author": "dirtysanchez69", "created": 1726263175615, "score_up": 459, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Msmcontrolsnarrative", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "media.scored.co", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "CAT\u00a0\u00a0LIVES\u00a0\u00a0MATTER", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.patriots.win/preview/1994tfWnDQ.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://media.patriots.win/post/6Ihln7IVlm15.jpeg", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [{"reference": "/scale/AqQb57FX4pwuusOy.jpeg", "width": 768, "content-type": "jpeg", "height": 382}], "blurhash": "U57-WoRPo0%M~q9F%Mxu9F9F-pj[xuayt7of", "full_resolution": [536, 1079]}, "title": "BREAKING: TRUMP ANNOUNCES HIS HOUSING PLAN -
