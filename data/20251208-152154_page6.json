Or YMCA. \n\nAlmost every big public event for going on 6 years now, he keeps having that song played. \n\nYou're most uncurious and your lack of curiosity serves you ill. \n\nYou know he's sending a message to certain highly organized criminals by doing this, right?  \n\nIt's why they literally tried to blow the top of his head off in Butler, PA. in July 2024. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=VlUnvWOjsIM\n\nThey came and stood behind him.\n\nCame and stood behind him for just ONE LINE. \n\nONE LINE of his 2017 Inauguration speech. \n\nJUST THE ONE LINE.\n\nJUST THE ONE. \n\nGo back and LOOK what that one line was. \n\nBack then, when he uttered that line, and they all came and stood behind him, the transnational crime syndicate he's been literally decoupling our country from over the past year still thought they could destroy him and make an example out of him. \n\nOr at the worst, they could CONTAIN him until he was gone. \n\nToday these people in the vast transnational crime syndicate FEAR him. \n\nThey're terrified of him. \n\nHe ate everything they threw at him for the past 8 years and HE'S STILL COMING AT THEM. \n\nStill stopping their human trafficking and their drug smuggling/trafficking.  Making life oh so very difficult for them. \n\nIt's like watching Godzilla get hit with atomic bombs and just growing bigger and more powerful.\n\nPeople who still scream every day that Trump should have had James Comey, Obama, Biden, the Clintons, whoever, arrested in his first term and tried in DC civilian courtroom at this point?\n\nThey still insist Trump was either dumb or a coward for not ordering the arrests from 2017-2021?\n\nAfter what they've seen for the last year with the civilian judiciary in this country? \n\nThey're so retarded they need to shut the fuck up at this point while the adults have a conversation about what's necessary.  \n\nOur institutions these dumb fucks keep looking to to 'fix' the corruption that's been exposed for the past year ARE THEMSELVES PART OF THE CORRUPTION. \n\nWHAT FUCKING PART OF THIS HAVE YOU MISSED?\n\nThat some of you still babble on here every day as if you don't understand or believe our federal courts and our US Congress and many of our federal agencies are utterly and totally and completely compromised and corrupted is pretty infuriating.  \n\nYou keep demanding people be arrested right-the-fuck-now so they can be tried in Judge Boasberg's courtroom.  \n\nYou keep demanding that our US Congress get in there and help Trump decouple this country from the transnational crime syndicate and enact his America First agenda. \n\nUnlike Trump's first term, you've literally been watching him and his 'Dream Team Cabinet' try to effect a REAL hostile takeover of our federal agencies, despite deeply embedded transnational crime syndicate agents trying to sabotage them at every turn. \n\nSo I'm going to say this as nicely as I can for those still stupidly babbling \n\n1. for the traitors to be tried in Boasberg's courtroom, \n\n2. for Congress to help Trump pass his anti-crime syndicate agenda, or \n\n3. endlessly whining about how long it's taking for Trump and his Cabinet to get actual control of a federal government that was literally trying to fucking KILL HIM or at the very least, imprison him for the rest of his life up until less than a year ago: \n\nSHUT.\n\nTHE.\n\nFUCK.\n\nUP. \n\nTHE ADULTS ARE TRYING TO HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO LISTEN TO YOUR STUPID SHIT. \n\nA very, very important conversation is starting about how we will save our country **despite** the fact our civilian courts and our civilian Congress and many of our federal agencies are have been so utterly corrupted and compromised by the evil we are fighting. \n\nYou have to decouple your country ENOUGH from the control of the vast transnational crime syndicate that's been surreptitiously controlling it and running it from the shadows for decades before a lot of stuff you want to see happen can happen.  \n\nYou have to WEAKEN the HYDRA by cutting off what it FEEDS ON, while you are dragging it from it's HIDDEN LAIRS and EXPOSING it so that you may at last cut off it's 3 big heads and KILL it. \n\nIt was FEEDING off our tax money, our Treasury. \n\nIt was HIDDEN inside of our own falderal government, and indeed, is STILL hiding in lairs its built inside many of our major US states and key strategic cities. About 24 of them.  \n\nThe vast transnational crime syndicates' TWO BIGGEST profit-producing crimes are\n\n1. Illegal immigrant cheap labor\n\nand\n\n2. Drugs\n\nThe vast crime syndicate that spent the past 50 years oh-so-carefully building a HIDDEN WORLD in our midst in America is now WEAKER than it has EVER been. \n\nBecause here's what all your celebrity media personalities and Cool Kid Social Media Influencers will not tell you: \n\nTrump and his Dream Team Cabinet have been slowly STRANGLING the Hydra the last year, exposing it and weakening it.  \n\nHe shut down the border and got control back and now they can't keep a NEW SUPPLY of warm bodies coming in here to join the 50 million+ illegals they had already let in on our dime, resettled with our money, and put to work for themselves at their company store.  \n\nHe shut down the border and put the military there - WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS FUCKING BEEN WHILE OUR COUNTRY WAS UNDER ATTACK FROM ACTS OF WAR - in order to vastly reduce the flow of chemical weapons into the United States. \n\nSo the two biggest profit-producing crimes the vast transnational crime syndicate uses to generate most of the funding to run it's criminal enterprises around the world have been SABOTAGED by Trump. \n\nTHEY sabotaged our country by looting the fuck out of us for decades, running a literal mass replacement migration for cheap illegal labor, and then using those same human trafficking networks to traffic mind-boggling amounts of lethal illegal drugs in here, and in less than one year, Trump SABOTAGED the fuckers RIGHT BACK and now their local criminal networks inside of our major cities are nearing collapse. \n\nThey don't have any new illegals coming in. \n\nIt's VERY HARD now to get the drugs in here.  \n\nThe transnational crime syndicate has a certain BASELINE earning level they need to maintain for their local crime networks that essentially run over 24 major key and strategic US cities. \n\nWhen their profits by the week/month **drops** below that baseline level, the local crime network starts to disintegrate.  \n\nWhat are the TWO MAIN THINGS the Democrat wing of the UniParty has fought SO HARD to do for the past couple of months? \n\nWhy has it gotten SO BAD for the vast transnational crime syndicate, that the GOP wing of the UniParty is now quite desperately having to JOIN the Democrat wing of the UniParty in attempting accomplish two main things? \n\n1. Stop the deportations/ICE raids/removals of 50 million + illegals currently here\n\nand\n\n2. Stop the Real War on Drugs that Trump has launched with the US Military under Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and demand a return to the old Fake War on drugs in the crime syndicate controlled federal/state courts.\n\nIt's gettin' HARD out there for a vast transnational crime syndicate associate. \n\nThey NEED these illegals to stay. As many as possible. They NEED the level drugs getting in here to go back to January 2025 levels.  \n\nTheir precious local crime network affiliates in NYC, Chicago, LA, Miami, Houston, Boston, Memphis, Charlotte, New Orleans, etc. etc. are under IMMENSE FINANCIAL PRESSURE RIGHT NOW. \n\nNot only have their DRUG profits cratered, Trump has made it CRYSTAL CLEAR that he is 100% serious about this:  \n\nEach of our major cities' local ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT HIDDEN CHEAP LABOR FORCE is going to be REMOVED from this country.  \n\nThey are ALL  going home.  \n\nAll of them. \n\nAll 50 million + \n\nTrump is SERIOUS about cutting off ALL  federal benefits to this truly massive and gargantuan sized illegal immigrant cheap labor force they've moved in here and resettled and have been supporting on OUR DIME.  \n\nIt's STARTING with EBT/SNAP, but you can ALREADY SEE the federal housing assistance moves being made to cut THAT OFF also.  \n\nI don't mean to shock you, but did you know? \n\nDid you know that **the entire reason** the vast transnational crime syndicate and treasonous political class performed a mass replacement migration of cheap illegal immigrant labor into the United States was that...it was CHEAP? \n\nThat they could make ASTOUNDING levels of profits from replacing a US labor force that cost them way more, with an imported very very CHEAP illegal labor force? \n\nThey realized an American worker with real rights that cost them $125,000/yr could be easily replaced with an illegal immigrant they had total control of, no rights at all, for only $30,000/yr? \n\nTHERE ARE WAY MORE OF THESE ILLEGAL SLAVE CLASS MEMBERS HERE THAN YOU THINK. \n\nAnd the vast majority of them have been put to work for the company store. A company store that OWNS them.  I don't call these people 'The New Slave Class' fer nothin'!\n\nKeep your eye on the trucking industry.  \n\nThis carefully crafted illusion that there's only around 25-30 million illegals living in this country, and most of those that are here are certainly NOT getting SNAP, buying houses or voting, and they CERTAINLY aren't getting hired for key jobs en masse, like say, driving massive trucks, is about to die a most cinematic death with scream. \n\nThere's 50 million+ illegal immigrants in here. \nThey are getting massive federal benefits. \nThey have almost ALL been put to work replacing you. \nThey are working jobs you would NEVER expect them to be in. \n\nYou have to understand: \n\nDonald J. Trump and his Dream Team Cabinet are not trying to PREVENT a mass replacement migration of cheap labor that's replaced the jobs of over 30 million+ Americans. \n\nYou have been deceived. \nYou been hoodwinked. \nYou done been bamboozled.  \n\nYou see, Trump and his Dream Team Cabinet, what they've ACTUALLY been doing, and will continue to do for the next 3 years, is REVERSE a mass replacement migration of cheap labor that ALREADY replaced over 30 million American workers with far cheaper illegal immigrant workers. \n\nYou got this really weird idea - maybe you got it from Fox News - that the big mass replacement migration of cheap illegal labor into this country was JUST STARTING up under Biden or something like that.  \n\nAnd as bad as things are right now, it would have been even worse and they'd have been able to keep MOVING FORWARD with their mass replacement migration strategy if Trump hadn't won the 2024 election. \n\nOh no. \n\nNo, my friend. \n\nThe true horror of our present situation has been cleverly kept from you.  \n\nThere's no 'mass replacement migration' STARTING under Joe Biden.  That was the ENDGAME. \n\nThey figured once they stole the 2020 election from Trump, and got control of the border back, they'd run an ENDGAME move of throwing that border wide open and ramping up the importation of cheap labor by over 20 million. \n\nTO JOIN THE 30 MILLION PLUS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE AND THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT TO WORK REPLACING YOU. \n\nI say again: Trump didn't PREVENT any massive gargantuan replacement migration.  \n\nIT ALREADY HAPPENED. \n\n50 million+ of them are ALREADY HERE.\n\nAnd of that 50 million+, MOST OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT TO WORK. \n\nAnd the vile people here in our country that implemented this mass replacement migration have been making obscene profits off of this scheme, this hidden illegal immigrant cheap labor world they've built in our midst, they could afford to do this scheme because YOU PAID FOR IT. \n\nA lot of the money that was used to make this massive replacement migration happen came from YOUR POCKET. \n\nWhile they were replacing you, they were making you pay for\n\n1. smuggling these people in here for 30+ years by looting our Treasury [under Biden they just threw the border open and let them walk in]\n\n2. transporting them by jet/bus/rail to their new location where they'd be put to work at waiting jobs\n\n3. temporarily housing/feeding them in hotels and places like that until permanent housing for them could be set up\n\n4. the permanent housing and most of their food benefits once they were settled in and working at their new jobs for the company store\n\nSo. How do you REVERSE a mass replacement migration like the one these people did to our country for the last 50 years, where there's now over 50 million of these illegals here?\n\nHow do you get them to leave and go back where they came from? \n\nWell the only thing that ALLOWS most of this 50 million+ to be here while they are paid extremely low wages compared to Americans is that...their vile greedy af employers do not have to pay enough to support their own food and housing.  Uncle Sam's been taking care of that.\n\nYOU have been paying what amounts to almost HALF of the money these illegals get every month.\n\nWhat happens when ALMOST HALF of the money the illegals have been getting is ENDED? \n\nWhat are the company store owners gonna do then? \n\nIf you're a greedy fuck, and you have 250 employees, and you swapped out quite deliberately 225 of your employees with illegals, so you could make an extra $3 million a year for yourself...and that was because you are only paying each of these illegals around $30,000/yr...\n\nAnd here comes President Donald J. Trump, clearly signaling he's gonna do exactly the ONE THING YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO DO...\n\n...when he cuts off the federal bennies to your illegal immigrant cheap labor work force of 225...\n\n...and now those 225 illegals and their families WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO STAY HERE ON JUST $30,000/YR, this is gonna give you a REALLY REALLY BAD HEADACHE you now have to deal with. \n\nThe COSTS of your 225 illegal immigrant cheap labor work force just DOUBLED. At the very least.\n\nThey now need **at least** $60,000/yr if they're gonna stay put and keep working in your sweat shop.  \n\nSo your 'cheap illegal immigrant work force' is...no longer cheap. \n\nAnd when these cheap af business owners are not able to or are not willing  to double the wages of their cheap illegal labor force, you're going to see an amazing thing happen. \n\nTHESE FAMILIES WILL LEAVE ON THEIR OWN. \n\nThat's right.  We're not going to have to have ICE raids on illegal immigrant families of truck drivers. When all of a sudden they can't afford their current housing, and they have to start low wages on food? \n\nThey leave. On their own. https://x.com/drawandstrike/status/1997685184322257064", "author": "catsfive", "created": 1765214567280, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Magma_Biscuit", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "", "removal_source": "", "link": "", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "To those DUMB FUCKS endlessly whining about how long it's taking for Trump and his Cabinet to get actual control of a federal government that was literally trying to fucking KILL HIM or at the very least, imprison him for the rest of his life up until less than a year ago: SHUT.

Trump and his Dream Team Cabinet are not trying to PREVENT a mass replacement migration of cheap labor that's replaced the jobs of over 30 million+ Americans.</p>\n<p>You have been deceived.\nYou been hoodwinked.\nYou done been bamboozled.</p>\n<p>You see, Trump and his Dream Team Cabinet, what they've ACTUALLY been doing, and will continue to do for the next 3 years, is REVERSE a mass replacement migration of cheap labor that ALREADY replaced over 30 million American workers with far cheaper illegal immigrant workers.</p>\n<p>You got this really weird idea - maybe you got it from Fox News - that the big mass replacement migration of cheap illegal labor into this country was JUST STARTING up under Biden or something like that.</p>\n<p>And as bad as things are right now, it would have been even worse and they'd have been able to keep MOVING FORWARD with their mass replacement migration strategy if Trump hadn't won the 2024 election.</p>\n<p>Oh no.</p>\n<p>No, my friend.</p>\n<p>The true horror of our present situation has been cleverly kept from you.</p>\n<p>There's no 'mass replacement migration' STARTING under Joe Biden.  That was the ENDGAME.</p>\n<p>They figured once they stole the 2020 election from Trump, and got control of the border back, they'd run an ENDGAME move of throwing that border wide open and ramping up the importation of cheap labor by over 20 million.</p>\n<p>TO JOIN THE 30 MILLION PLUS THAT WERE ALREADY HERE AND THAT THEY HAD ALREADY PUT TO WORK REPLACING YOU.</p>\n<p>I say again: Trump didn't PREVENT any massive gargantuan replacement migration.</p>\n<p>IT ALREADY HAPPENED.</p>\n<p>50 million+ of them are ALREADY HERE.</p>\n<p>And of that 50 million+, MOST OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUT TO WORK.</p>\n<p>And the vile people here in our country that implemented this mass replacement migration have been making obscene profits off of this scheme, this hidden illegal immigrant cheap labor world they've built in our midst, they could afford to do this scheme because YOU PAID FOR IT.</p>\n<p>A lot of the money that was used to make this massive replacement migration happen came from YOUR POCKET.</p>\n<p>While they were replacing you, they were making you pay for</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>smuggling these people in here for 30+ years by looting our Treasury [under Biden they just threw the border open and let them walk in]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>transporting them by jet/bus/rail to their new location where they'd be put to work at waiting jobs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>temporarily housing/feeding them in hotels and places like that until permanent housing for them could be set up</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the permanent housing and most of their food benefits once they were settled in and working at their new jobs for the company store</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So. How do you REVERSE a mass replacement migration like the one these people did to our country for the last 50 years, where there's now over 50 million of these illegals here?</p>\n<p>How do you get them to leave and go back where they came from?</p>\n<p>Well the only thing that ALLOWS most of this 50 million+ to be here while they are paid extremely low wages compared to Americans is that...their vile greedy af employers do not have to pay enough to support their own food and housing.  Uncle Sam's been taking care of that.</p>\n<p>YOU have been paying what amounts to almost HALF of the money these illegals get every month.</p>\n<p>What happens when ALMOST HALF of the money the illegals have been getting is ENDED?</p>\n<p>What are the company store owners gonna do then?</p>\n<p>If you're a greedy fuck, and you have 250 employees, and you swapped out quite deliberately 225 of your employees with illegals, so you could make an extra $3 million a year for yourself...and that was because you are only paying each of these illegals around $30,000/yr...</p>\n<p>And here comes President Donald J. Trump, clearly signaling he's gonna do exactly the ONE THING YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO DO...</p>\n<p>...when he cuts off the federal bennies to your illegal immigrant cheap labor work force of 225...</p>\n<p>...and now those 225 illegals and their families WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO STAY HERE ON JUST $30,000/YR, this is gonna give you a REALLY REALLY BAD HEADACHE you now have to deal with.</p>\n<p>The COSTS of your 225 illegal immigrant cheap labor work force just DOUBLED. At the very least.</p>\n<p>They now need <strong>at least</strong> $60,000/yr if they're gonna stay put and keep working in your sweat shop.</p>\n<p>So your 'cheap illegal immigrant work force' is...no longer cheap.</p>\n<p>And when these cheap af business owners are not able to or are not willing  to double the wages of their cheap illegal labor force, you're going to see an amazing thing happen.</p>\n<p>THESE FAMILIES WILL LEAVE ON THEIR OWN.</p>\n<p>That's right.  We're not going to have to have ICE raids on illegal immigrant families of truck drivers. When all of a sudden they can't afford their current housing, and they have to start low wages on food?</p>\n<p>They leave. On their own. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/drawandstrike/status/1997685184322257064\" target=\"_blank\">https://x.com/drawandstrike/status/1997685184322257064</a></p>\n", "score_down": 6, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 15, "score_up": 55, "is_edited": false, "is_moderator": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "archive_id": ""}, {"is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "is_video_mp4": false, "type": "link", "uuid": "1ARdD8VG3K", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "score": 133, "suggested_sort": 0, "post_flair_class": "", "id": 8241546, "raw_content": "", "author": "Bidensuckscocks", "created": 1765194960824, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "CyanScales", "is_video": true, "video_link": "https://cdn.videy.co/JQWmt29x1.mp4", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "cdn.videy.co", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "", "removal_source": "", "link": "https://cdn.videy.co/JQWmt29x1.mp4", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Hungary exposes the European Union's Extortion to Accept the Migration Pact:\n\n\"I have to pay every day \u20ac1,000,000 as a punishment because Hungary doesn't follow the pro-migration policy of the commission.\"", "last_comment_created": 1765209304796, "content": "", "score_down": 1, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 5, "score_up": 134, "is_edited": false, "is_moderator": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "archive_id": ""}, {"is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "is_video_mp4": false, "type": "link", "uuid": "1ARdD9cHWi", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "score": 50, "suggested_sort": 0, "post_flair_class": "", "id": 8242070, "raw_content": "", "author": "KuonFan", "created": 1765214053695, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "BrianOfNazareth", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": true, "domain": "www.foxnews.com", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "https://media.scored.co/preview/1ARdD9cHWi.png", "removal_source": "", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/ice-warns-illinois-releasing-violent-criminal-illegal-aliens-despite-detainers-risking-public-safety", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Illinois is releasing pedos and human traffickers instead of giving them to ICE.
