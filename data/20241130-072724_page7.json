You know it, I know it, everyone knows it&quot; even though I wanted to.

I guess I had a little halo on yesterday or something.</p>\n<p>It's really weird, because I know my sister can be one of the best friends I've ever had, but she's really been corrupted in CO, brainwashed is an understatement.  This is a PHD carrying person who used to be conservative, intelligent, and BRILLIANT with medicine, homeopathic home care, and she specialized in wound-ostomy care.  Now she's a fucking DUNCE and I don't understand how moving to a new place can do that to someone, but it certainly did.</p>\n<p>I pray constantly to get my sister back from the dark side, but as the 2nd/last child in my family, the son and not the daughter, I have been fighting my 39.8 years of my life to get any of my father's &quot;favor.&quot;  I worked for his family business for 15 years and it nearly killed me - I was going down like a hot blazing firey airplane crash and nothing was going to save me, but when Covid hit I found other opportunities to make a living and I took the leap of faith, God as my shield, and it worked out swimmingly.  Double happiness, double money, inspired me to get fit, eat right, quit drinking (though admittedly I'm drinking a bit as a celebration this day), etc.  And then the cherry on top was yesterday, my plan to not be overtly annoying or patriotic and just see what might happen without ME being &quot;the trigger,&quot; and that libtard princess went after my dad's beloved baby brother.</p>\n<p>My dad started attacking &quot;woke behavior&quot; - and while I sorta bit my tongue a bit because he's been PAMPERING that type of behavior, it was so cathartic and odd to watch this meltdown occur live and the fact that I had not a damn thing to do with it.</p>\n<p>Thanksgiving ended rather abruptly but now I get to have a private Thanksgiving at home with my wife's cooking, and to be honest, she's the best cook there is and I don't have to share.</p>\n<p>Today is a good day.

And to add to the story and make yet another long complicated story short, let's just say my father, who I worked with for 15 years in a family business, used to drive me crazy by telling customers his daughter worked for the CDC and knew all this \"Covid shit\" back in the day, and it would drive me up a wall for two reasons; one because CDC is fake and gay, two because my dumbass old man was once again doing everything for his baby girl and ignoring the truth.\n\nSo yesterday my \"princess sister\" decided to do one of those weird \"woke storm-outs\" during Thanksgiving when my Uncle, who literally had just hooked my sister up with a really expensive car-part, happened to let it slip that the vaccine really messed his wife up.  I was in a different room of the house at the time just chilling and talking with my other Aunt and Uncle so missed the exchange, but saw her storming out of the house and didn't know what was up.\n\nMy dad throughout the day proceeded to get drunker and drunker and told me how right I have been all this time etc., and I couldn't help but cackle madly at everything transpiring.  You see, usually I am the one that wears Trump gear to the family events, and even though 90% of my family was with me when I would do that, it would irk a few.  This year, I decided my plan would be to act COMPLETELY apolitical and just enjoy my family and their company for a change, I wore no MAGA gear and didn't wear my new sexy red hoodie that says \"Merry Christmas, it'll be the most terrific Christmas, believe me.  You know it, I know it, everyone knows it\" even though I wanted to.  My plan was to just let the libtard fuck up, and boy howdy did it ever come to fruition.\n\nEveryone left early (besides my sister, who has to stay with my dad since she's from out of town), and my dad showed me emails from my family that were saying how great of a time they had talking to ME!  I guess I had a little halo on yesterday or something.  \n\nIt's really weird, because I know my sister can be one of the best friends I've ever had, but she's really been corrupted in CO, brainwashed is an understatement.  This is a PHD carrying person who used to be conservative, intelligent, and BRILLIANT with medicine, homeopathic home care, and she specialized in wound-ostomy care.  Now she's a fucking DUNCE and I don't understand how moving to a new place can do that to someone, but it certainly did.\n\nI pray constantly to get my sister back from the dark side, but as the 2nd/last child in my family, the son and not the daughter, I have been fighting my 39.8 years of my life to get any of my father's \"favor.\"  I worked for his family business for 15 years and it nearly killed me - I was going down like a hot blazing firey airplane crash and nothing was going to save me, but when Covid hit I found other opportunities to make a living and I took the leap of faith, God as my shield, and it worked out swimmingly.  Double happiness, double money, inspired me to get fit, eat right, quit drinking (though admittedly I'm drinking a bit as a celebration this day), etc.  And then the cherry on top was yesterday, my plan to not be overtly annoying or patriotic and just see what might happen without ME being \"the trigger,\" and that libtard princess went after my dad's beloved baby brother.\n\nMy dad started attacking \"woke behavior\" - and while I sorta bit my tongue a bit because he's been PAMPERING that type of behavior, it was so cathartic and odd to watch this meltdown occur live and the fact that I had not a damn thing to do with it.  \n\nThanksgiving ended rather abruptly but now I get to have a private Thanksgiving at home with my wife's cooking, and to be honest, she's the best cook there is and I don't have to share.  \n\nToday is a good day.  GOD BLESS YOU ALL, much love, and MAGA!  \n\nWe're so back, baby.", "comments": 87, "author": "Covidrrhea", "created": 1732900331868, "score_up": 660, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Taliesin", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.scored.co/preview/199hzO48TA.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/modern-day-censorship/mel-gibsons-role-in-fighting-child-exploitation-and-raising-awareness-about-the-fight-against-pedophilia/", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "RIO TIMES: Mel Gibson\u2019s role in fighting child exploitation and raising awareness about the fight against pedophilia", "type": "link", "last_comment_created": 1732953235780, "uuid": "199hzO48TA", "content": "", "score_down": 0, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 54, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "id": 7283660, "raw_content": "", "comments": 2, "author": "Sunnybats2", "created": 1732948727904, "score_up": 54, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Odyssey", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "www.riotimesonline.com", "link_metadata": {"description": "Mel Gibson has been a subject of controversy for his alleged involvement in child trafficking, pedophilia, and pedofilia.", "large_image": "lQ5anXjQqZNAgBUA.png", "title": "Mel Gibson's role in fighting child exploitation and raising awareness about the fight against pedophilia"}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.scored.co/preview/199hzO4PBf.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://rumble.com/v5u4iwq-trump-lawyer-mike-davis-drops-bomb-on-biden-regime-lawfare-agents....-bam.html?e9s=src_v1_upp", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Trump Lawyer Mike Davis drops BOMB on Biden Regime lawfare agents....
