Probably more than 10%. Maybe as much as 15%.</p>\n<p>There are two locations where this should be possible given the PA election site. I chose the York County Elections Office on Pleasant Valley Rd. You walk in, plenty of signs pointing you to where to vote. It is the same room I have done every poll watcher training since I have lived here.</p>\n<p>Walk in, the room is mostly full. Probably 10-15 percent empty seats at about 9 AM. The room filled up more as I was there. You are handed a xerox'd application for a mail in ballot. Pretty straight forward and they take it in the back. 40 minutes later I had a ballot. Instructions, papers everything, exactly the same from my eye as if you requested a mail in ballot. I never requested one but I have seen them in person.</p>\n<p>Notable things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>There really is no reason for this to have taken so long. They should have seen this coming so not sure why they wouldn't have added additional staff for opening, closing, and lunch. That's when people are showing up. Not at 2:00 PM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A lot of people had no idea what they were doing when attempting to vote. You can listen around the room and people were asking really retarded questions. Only retarded questions I heard came from elderly women.

So I did it. This is basically where and what I saw.\n\nMy resident county is York county. So YMMV depending. Trump won this county in a blowout in 2020 from what I recall. Probably more than 10%. Maybe as much as 15%.\n\nThere are two locations where this should be possible given the PA election site. I chose the York County Elections Office on Pleasant Valley Rd. You walk in, plenty of signs pointing you to where to vote. It is the same room I have done every poll watcher training since I have lived here.\n\nWalk in, the room is mostly full. Probably 10-15 percent empty seats at about 9 AM. The room filled up more as I was there. You are handed a xerox'd application for a mail in ballot. Pretty straight forward and they take it in the back. 40 minutes later I had a ballot. Instructions, papers everything, exactly the same from my eye as if you requested a mail in ballot. I never requested one but I have seen them in person.\n\nNotable things.\n\n1. There really is no reason for this to have taken so long. They should have seen this coming so not sure why they wouldn't have added additional staff for opening, closing, and lunch. That's when people are showing up. Not at 2:00 PM. \n\n2.
