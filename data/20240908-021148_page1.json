The leaders that hold communist values in our small towns and cities are more effective than those in the Cold War era. They know the speech, topics, and platitudes they can use to sway weak minds of all ages, backgrounds, and even political parties. Cloaking yourself with an R besides, your name doesn't prevent a politician from secretly holding communist views. MAGA is no exception. Look no further than the open Marxist, Jackson Hinkle openly touting MAGA communism. Evil!</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Ronald Reagan</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Early in his professional career, Ronald Reagan saw communism as a threat to America's freedom and prosperity. He championed anti-communist policies, and worked hard to prevent communism from taking over film industry unions. Following his time as president of SAG, he ran campaigns against communism, and socialized medicine, entering into politics, and ultimately beating the weak Jimmy Carter to win the presidency. Reagan's achievements made America great in the previous century and no doubt influenced President Trump's fight to Make America Great Again!</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Your Turn</strong></strong></p>\n<p>Donald J.

The Mosinee Paper Corporation established early in the 20th century played a major role in the town's past economic growth.\r\n\r\nThese are pretty typical facts for most small towns in America but what sets it apart from other towns is that ****Mosinee staged a mock Communist take over in the 1950's!****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n****The Plan****\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1950 the American Legion planned to simulate what a communist takeover would look like in small-town America. The American Legion wanted to highlight the dangers of communism and the loss of individual freedom that would be experienced under a communist regime. \r\n\r\n****Execution of the Coup****\r\n\r\nOn May 1, 1950 the mock communist dictatorship took over Mosinee. Local leaders which included the mayor, police, chief and other city leaders were \"arrested\" and replaced by individuals LARPing as communist officials. \r\n\r\nThe legion decorated the streets with red flags, citizens carried communist identification papers, and the city was renamed Moskva.\r\n\r\nBusinesses were forced to close, food rationing was instituted, and long lines were formed for citizens to wait in for the most basic of goods and services. \r\n\r\nThe Townhall was transformed into a political reeducation venue, and sessions were held to reeducate towns people in the \"virtues\" of communism in a satirical manner. \r\n\r\n****The Aftermath****\r\n\r\nWhile the event was successful in raising awareness of communism, there was one tragic outcome in that the current mayor at the time suffered a fatal stroke a day after the event. \r\n\r\nHistorians seized on this one negative outcome of the event and effectively leveraged it to combat one town's actions to warn American's against the rise of communist totalitarianism.\r\n\r\nThe original Cold War is over, but the threat of communists achieving a foothold in American leadership has soldiered on. The leaders that hold communist values in our small towns and cities are more effective than those in the Cold War era. They know the speech, topics, and platitudes they can use to sway weak minds of all ages, backgrounds, and even political parties. Cloaking yourself with an R besides, your name doesn't prevent a politician from secretly holding communist views. MAGA is no exception. Look no further than the open Marxist, Jackson Hinkle openly touting MAGA communism. Evil!\r\n\r\n****Ronald Reagan****\r\n\r\nEarly in his professional career, Ronald Reagan saw communism as a threat to America's freedom and prosperity. He championed anti-communist policies, and worked hard to prevent communism from taking over film industry unions. Following his time as president of SAG, he ran campaigns against communism, and socialized medicine, entering into politics, and ultimately beating the weak Jimmy Carter to win the presidency. Reagan's achievements made America great in the previous century and no doubt influenced President Trump's fight to Make America Great Again!\r\n\r\n****Your Turn****\r\n\r\nDonald J. Trump carries the torch against communism, this time, not battling the evil Soviet empire, but that of an internal communist apparatus seeking to topple our democratic Republic.\r\n\r\nPlease join the conversation here and join the voter registration and get out the vote efforts via [Trump Force 47](https://trumpforce47.com)\r\n\r\n****LIVE: President Donald J.
