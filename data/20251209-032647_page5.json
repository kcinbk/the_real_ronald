He may need people to tell him to do it. This is why I hope he starts going back to doing rallies pretty soon, so people would have the chance to beg him to invoke the Insurrection Act, and maybe then that'd get it through to him to do it.</p>\n", "score_down": 1, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 14, "score_up": 58, "is_edited": false, "is_moderator": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "archive_id": ""}, {"is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "is_video_mp4": false, "type": "link", "uuid": "1ARdD8VGFk", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "score": 887, "suggested_sort": 0, "post_flair_class": "", "id": 8241578, "raw_content": "", "author": "blackswans", "created": 1765196300085, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "LibsRcrazy", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "www.breitbart.com", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "https://media.scored.co/preview/1ARdD8VGFk.png", "removal_source": "", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/12/07/rosie-odonnells-therapist-told-her-to-ignore-trump-for-two-days-she-only-lasted-two-hours/", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Therapist Told Her to Ignore Trump for Two Days, She Only Lasted Two Hours", "last_comment_created": 1765244388239, "content": "", "score_down": 5, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 54, "score_up": 892, "is_edited": false, "is_moderator": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "link_metadata": {"description": "Rosie O'Donnell seems unable to heed the advice of her own therapist who told her to try \"detaching\" from her hatred for Donald Trump.", "large_image": "7PJF8dOLtWdLoOvE.png", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell's Therapist Told Her to Ignore Trump for Two Days, She Only Lasted Two Hours"}, "post_flair_text": "", "archive_id": ""}, {"is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "is_video_mp4": false, "type": "link", "uuid": "1ARdDAm35n", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "score": 33, "suggested_sort": 0, "post_flair_class": "", "id": 8243543, "raw_content": "", "author": "Capoditutticapi1", "created": 1765260607370, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Blackmore", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "media.scored.co", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "https://media.scored.co/preview/1ARdDAm35n.png", "removal_source": "", "link": "https://media.scored.co/post/LL9JM2oBguab.jpeg", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [{"reference": "/scale/j3owLqPkbZI7y6C9.jpeg", "width": 527, "content-type": "jpeg", "height": 768}], "blurhash": "U3A,tZ~XIn%M00Rkxuay00M{%MWB0JRixuRk", "full_resolution": [1738, 1193]}, "title": "Why should 1 out of 700 federal judges be able to unilaterally seize control of the federal government?
