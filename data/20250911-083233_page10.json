He was still killed anyway, in broad daylight.  The media, leftists, even plain liberals, are celebrating this, by the millions.  Not some fringe; a large bulk of them.

The thing is, we are heading to the point where it's not just the severely mentally ill Leftists that see us as dehumanized enough to murder.  We're heading to the point where the somewhat mentally ill see us as stripped of enough humanity.  That's what leaders on the Left want.  They are going to keep pounding away, stripping away our humanity until practically everyone on the Left sees us as fair game.

You need to be able to defend yourself against what comes next. You NEED to be armed, preferably every member of your family, both within your house, and with a daily carry weapon.  Because within a few years, letting slip in public that you're conservative is going to be a potentially deadly mistake.  We are accelerating towards balkanization.  If you can't conceal carry and stand your ground, you're a target where you live.  That's just the sad truth.  You can either get out now, or fight your way out later.
