To my knowledge he never mentioned eating dogs and cats before then.  I may be wrong,  I said mom, 1500 people tell you it's happening.  One person says it isn't and you believe it.  &quot;There is no proof. &quot; Then she tells me about the fake cat eating video where a woman had fur on her lips.  I said that wasn't from Springfield but I am pretty sure it was real.   No it's not.Somehow that turned into Trump was gonna hang Pence.  I said, he never said anything like that.
