", "type": "text", "last_comment_created": 1727349098574, "uuid": "1995CKXAu3", "content": "<p>Before I get started, I should say I had a difficult childhood. My mother was diagnosed with Leukemia when I was 5 years old, and she died shortly after my 6th birthday. We lived in Bay City, Texas back then - far away from all of my dad\u2019s relatives in Austin. We moved there when I was 7 to be closer to family.</p>\n<p>My dad then started worked as a car salesman- he was qualified to do different work, but that presented the best way to make the most amount of money. He was very good at it, but the hours were long. My siblings and I really never saw him until he dragged himself home every night, usually after 9 pm. He was a great father, and he made the kind of sacrifices that you really don\u2019t see much of anymore.</p>\n<p>It was my brother who finally exposed me to the truth, on Christmas Eve when I was 9 years old. The reason why he picked that moment to tell me remains unclear - he would say that he felt like it was something that he had to do, but I have a feeling that he was getting back at me for accidentally revealing that Darth Vader was Luke\u2019s father.</p>\n<p>Whatever the case, I was heartbroken, and I didn\u2019t want to accept it. I made the decision to wait up all night - in the hallway adjacent to the living room - so I could finally catch Santa in the act and prove to my brother (as well as myself) that he was wrong. Shortly after midnight, I got my answer - my dad, who would give Santa all of the credit later that morning, brought in a bicycle to put next to the tree.</p>\n<p>As I look back on that experience and those years, I start to understand why it took me so long to stop believing in Santa, despite having friends who told me that no such person existed. I have whittled it down to 3 reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The grief over losing my mother - I probably wanted to hold onto childhood longer than I should have. It really was the only escape from reality that I had left.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When I was 8 years old, my dad had paid for one of those services that mail you a letter from \u201cSanta\u201d, which included your name and some personal details he had shared for them to include in the correspondence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The news stations and media all insisted that Santa Claus was real. As a matter of fact, one of my strongest arguments for his existence- or so I thought - was that there was no way that \u201ceveryone\u201d could be in on it. Even the weatherman, who got his information from \u201cNORAD\u201d (whatever that was), had a \u201cLive Santa Tracker\u201d that showed exactly where St. Nick was during the forecast.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you\u2019ve read this far, you have probably been able to piece together where I\u2019m going with this: I believed in Santa because I wanted to believe, and I had authority figures telling me that I was right. How is a Democrat any different? They are told that a party cares about them, which they desperately want to believe, and every authority figure they know reaffirms that belief. Moreover, when they tell you that something or someone is \u201cbad\u201d, it has to be true. Why would they lie about that? Why would every institution work together, seemingly in lockstep, to push a singular narrative? Why, that\u2019s too far-fetched to believe! \u201cThey\u201d (the authority figures) would never do that!</p>\n<p>The story of why I believed in Santa for so long is not unique - in fact, it may be an intrinsic part of being human.

My mother was diagnosed with Leukemia when I was 5 years old, and she died shortly after my 6th birthday. We lived in Bay City, Texas back then - far away from all of my dad\u2019s relatives in Austin. We moved there when I was 7 to be closer to family. \r\n\r\nMy dad then started worked as a car salesman- he was qualified to do different work, but that presented the best way to make the most amount of money. He was very good at it, but the hours were long. My siblings and I really never saw him until he dragged himself home every night, usually after 9 pm. He was a great father, and he made the kind of sacrifices that you really don\u2019t see much of anymore. \r\n\r\nIt was my brother who finally exposed me to the truth, on Christmas Eve when I was 9 years old. The reason why he picked that moment to tell me remains unclear - he would say that he felt like it was something that he had to do, but I have a feeling that he was getting back at me for accidentally revealing that Darth Vader was Luke\u2019s father. \r\n\r\nWhatever the case, I was heartbroken, and I didn\u2019t want to accept it. I made the decision to wait up all night - in the hallway adjacent to the living room - so I could finally catch Santa in the act and prove to my brother (as well as myself) that he was wrong. Shortly after midnight, I got my answer - my dad, who would give Santa all of the credit later that morning, brought in a bicycle to put next to the tree. \r\n\r\nAs I look back on that experience and those years, I start to understand why it took me so long to stop believing in Santa, despite having friends who told me that no such person existed. I have whittled it down to 3 reasons: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) The grief over losing my mother - I probably wanted to hold onto childhood longer than I should have. It really was the only escape from reality that I had left. \r\n\r\n\r\n2) When I was 8 years old, my dad had paid for one of those services that mail you a letter from \u201cSanta\u201d, which included your name and some personal details he had shared for them to include in the correspondence. \r\n\r\n\r\n3) The news stations and media all insisted that Santa Claus was real. As a matter of fact, one of my strongest arguments for his existence- or so I thought - was that there was no way that \u201ceveryone\u201d could be in on it. Even the weatherman, who got his information from \u201cNORAD\u201d (whatever that was), had a \u201cLive Santa Tracker\u201d that showed exactly where St. Nick was during the forecast. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you have probably been able to piece together where I\u2019m going with this: I believed in Santa because I wanted to believe, and I had authority figures telling me that I was right. How is a Democrat any different? They are told that a party cares about them, which they desperately want to believe, and every authority figure they know reaffirms that belief. Moreover, when they tell you that something or someone is \u201cbad\u201d, it has to be true. Why would they lie about that? Why would every institution work together, seemingly in lockstep, to push a singular narrative? Why, that\u2019s too far-fetched to believe! \u201cThey\u201d (the authority figures) would never do that! \r\n\r\nThe story of why I believed in Santa for so long is not unique - in fact, it may be an intrinsic part of being human.
