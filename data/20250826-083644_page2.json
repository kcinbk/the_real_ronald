That in turn boosts spending, stock prices, and 401(k) accounts.\n\nThe president has also repeatedly flirted with ousting Powell as he seeks to lower rates by political force.\n\nLast week, Scott Bessent, the White House's Treasury Secretary, said he would start interviewing Powell's replacements in September, nine months before the chair's term expires.  \n\nEarlier this month, Trump named Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the rest of the term that opened from Governor Adriana Kugler's unexpected exit. \n\nBill Pulte, a Trump appointee to the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, made the accusations official last week.\n\nPulte alleges that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. \n\nThe regulator also posted a part of his letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi, saying his agency had obtained Cook's mortgage documents, and citing the two loans from June and July 2021.\n\n'She needs to quit because what she did is grounds for firing,' he wrote in a separate post. \n\nThe announcement came days after Cook said she wouldn't leave her post despite Trump previously calling for her to resign. The Fed's board has seven members, meaning Trump's move could have deep economic and political ramifications.\n\nMortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.\n\nTrump said in announcing the move that he had the constitutional authority to remove Cook, but doing so will raise questions about control of the Fed as an independent entity.\n\nThe firing is likely to touch off a legal battle and Cook could be allowed to remain in her seat while the case plays out. \n\nCook would have to fight the legal battle herself, as the injured party, rather than the Fed.\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/yourmoney/article-15033783/Trump-fires-Federal-Reserve-governor.html\n\n", "author": "CloudNine", "created": 1756198448661, "profile_picture": "xH7jsorrxzY0", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "LibsRcrazy", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "", "removal_source": "", "link": "", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Federal Reserve governor 'fired' by Trump issues scathing rebuke claiming president has no authority over central bank", "last_comment_created": 1756207324057, "content": "<p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has begun a standoff with Donald Trump, refusing to leave her post after Trump announced he had fired her Monday evening.</p>\n<p>Cook's sacking was the first in the 111-year history of the Federal Reserve, as Trump all but guaranteed a replacement that would back the president's calls to slash interest rates.</p>\n<p>However, Cook released a statement on Monday night that suggested she wasn't going anywhere.</p>\n<p>President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so,' she said.
