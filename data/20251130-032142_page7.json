It makes more than 90 percent of the world\u2019s rare earth magnets, according to International Energy Agency data. China is also the sole supplier for certain elements such as samarium, used in fighter jets and nuclear reactors for its high heat resistance.\nThis dominance comes from decades of strategic investment, lavish state subsidies, and aggressive market manipulation that stifled foreign competition.\n\nDecisions made in the United States also played a part.\n\n\nUntil 1991, the country was a leading rare earth producer, with the Mountain Pass mine in California supplying most of the world. Environmental troubles then shuttered the mine for years at the same time China began to gain a foothold.\nAgainst the Pentagon\u2019s objections, the U.S. government greenlit the 1995 sale of Magnequench, then the industry leader in rare earth magnets, to a Chinese front group, effectively handing over critical defense technology and manufacturing to China.\n\nIn 2004, Magnequench shuttered its Indiana plant and moved operations to China. Beijing started taxing rare earth exports the following year.\n\nFast forward 20 years, the United States is now beholden to Chinese minerals.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t realize that we were selling something that turned out to be very important to our country,\u201d Tour said.\n\nimage-5950359\nThe Mountain Pass mine is an open-pit mine of rare earth elements in California.

It\u2019s now the fastest growing type of waste, rising five times faster than recycling, according to the United Nations.\nThe United States produced 7.2 million tons of electronic waste in 2022\u2014about one eighth of the world\u2019s total, the latest U.N. data show. That\u2019s about 46 pounds for every American.\n\n\u201cWe have these mountains of tailings that we can access, and we have these constant mountains of printed circuit boards,\u201d Tour said.\n\nTour said that their method could clean up this spiraling nightmare of waste sites, and turn it into a \u201ctreasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a win-win all around.\u201d\n\nLucas Eddy, technology development manager for Metallium\u2019s Texas subsidiary Flash Metals USA, is now seeing the idea being put into practice.\n\n\u201cThe real reason a waste product is a waste product isn\u2019t because it\u2019s bad, it\u2019s because it can\u2019t be used,\u201d he told The Epoch Times.\n\nHere\u2019s where flash Joule heating shines, said Eddy, whose Texas factory has licensed the method for metal recovery.\n\n\u201cThis is the future of flash Joule heating.\u201d\nOld Tech Reimagined\nJoule heating\u2014passing an electric current through a conductor to produce heat\u2014has been around since the 1840s.

Rare earths, usually with some of the highest boiling points, tend to come out last\u2014often as a white powder, he said.\n\nThe project drew interest from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which asked them to make it more industrially applicable, Tour said. Under a federal contract, the team worked on lowering boiling points, experimenting with fluorides and chlorine in various forms, and eventually settled on chlorine gas.\n\nThat step was \u201crevolutionary,\u201d said Eddy.\n\n\nUntil now, electronic recycling has largely relied on submerging electronic components in strong acids, an approach that creates large amounts of toxic chemicals. An alternative is to heat up materials in furnaces, an energy intensive process that requires high upfront investment and additional purification.\nConverting metals to chlorides bypasses that intermediate step.\n\nThe ultrafast heating and cooling rate also cuts down energy use\u2014by as much as 87 percent, according to a Tour co-authored paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in late September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s much cleaner and much faster,\u201d said Tour.\n\u2018Every Scientist\u2019s Dream\u2019\nThe technique has wide environmental applications beyond rare earth metals.\nThe researchers have used it to remove toxic metals from red mud, the byproduct of aluminum production, leaving an aluminum-rich material that can go into ceramic tiles or back into the regular aluminum production cycle.\n\nJewelry manufacturers have approached them for the gold in the electronics, and others sought the purified glass on cell phones after they extract lithium, Tour said.\n\nEven the plastic parts on the print circuit boards can be useful, he said.
