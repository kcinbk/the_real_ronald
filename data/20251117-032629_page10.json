people (basically, anyone who has never been paying on a mortgage for a good stretch of time) do not understand why a longterm mortgage is not that burdensome.  It was harder for people in their early-to-mid 20s to buy a mortgage during the disruption of the Covid scamdemic and the tepid return to quasi-normal.\n\nA policy that lowers the monthly mortgage rate through a 50-year term makes it possible for more first-time buyers to finance a house.\n\nBut the vociferous complaints about the possibility of a 50-year mortgage term by the left (and faux-MAGA \"influencers\") are resonating among people in their late 20s because many in this generation they have spent half a decade without being able to finance a mortgage (hard to do that with an uncertain economy during the covid scamdemic and tepid economic recovery thereafter).\n\nThis generation has seen credit card debts appreciating faster than they can be paid off.  So it would be natural - but incorrect - if they were to assume that a 50-year mortgage term means debt slavery.\n\nIt's all about getting that first house through financing, and staying in it long enough to have far more options than people who have never bought a house.  Basically, if a person has gotten to the point of being able to make monthly payments on a longterm mortgage, the burden is less and less as time goes on.\n\nHere is how it works:\n\n1. There is a tax deduction on interest for a primary residence;\n\n2. Inflation / cost of living continue to rise over the years but fixed-rate mortgage payments do not;\n\n3. After a decent period of time with a mortgage - e.g., 20 years - the mortgage payments look ridiculously small compared to the cost of renting a house or an apartment in a safe and well-run apartment complex;\n\n4.  It becomes easier and easier to pay off the mortgage as incomes adjust to inflation but the mortgage remains the same or even decreases (if it is a combination of a shorter-term and comparatively longer term loans, when the shorter term mortgage is paid off, there is a sudden drop in what is owed each month);\n\n5.  Many people will sell a primary residence before the mortgage is paid off, in order to enter into a new mortgage agreement for a new primary residence.  As long as the money is rolled from the sale of the 1st house into the new house, there is no federal income tax for the sale.  A lot of people will buy a lower-end first house, wait 15 - 20 years, and roll it over into a new house.  The appreciation in value of the first house means the person can have a higher percentage of equity (=value of house in excess of loan debt) in the new house than he had when he originally purchased the first house.\n\nProvided that you do not buy a house in a decaying neighborhood of a state that is suffering from a mass exodus of citizens (think of all the abandoned shacks in Detroit), here is what this all means:\n\nOnce you can stomach the monthly payment of a 50-year loan, you can spend some years in the house and get to the point where it is easier and easier to pay down the mortgage much faster (e.g., pay off in 25 years, not 50) or roll the proceeds of selling it at a much higher price (e.g., 15 years later) into a new house with a shorter mortgage term (20/30 year mortgage).\n\nThe big barrier to entry is to save up enough to get to the point of buying the first primary residence.  If a 50-year mortgage makes that easier, it means that more younger citizens will escape the trap of paying rent on a house or apartment.  And more younger citizens will enjoy the benefits of an appreciating asset with monthly loan payments that become smaller and smaller (compared to the economy/cost of living) as time goes on.\n\nEveryone on PDW who has had a mortgage for a good stint understands these things.\n\nAs I write this post, it occurs to me that the left's goal is not only to bring about historical amnesia (as in Orwell's 1984, when people do not know history it is harder to challenge Big Brother's narrative), but also to make it so that people are unaware of basic strategies for life that everyone used to know.\n\nA 5-year disruption to our economy was enough to create a huge number of people in their late 20s who have never had the experience of buying (and staying in) a primary residence through financing.  And if enough people are unaware of how it really works with a mortgage, they may fear and oppose the idea of spreading out a loan over a longer term to enable a first-time buyer to stop renting a place he can never own.\n\nEdit:  I'll just say this as a final comment.  My first mortgage was as long as I could stretch it in time and all I was paying was interest.  The interest rate was horrible.  But I had a house with the mortgage.  When I sold the house, it's sold for twice the amount of the original mortgage.  I sure didn't put much into equity (all mostly interest payments), yet it meant that I had substantial equity when it was time to sell the house.\n\nPresident Trump spent his entire life in real estate before becoming president and he knows how it works with appreciating property.  I don't think he was being asinine and clueless when he spoke about 50-year mortgages.  I think he had in mind getting more people to break through the owner vs. renter divide - because the benefits of an appreciating asset start to outweigh the pitiful progress in monthly payments on equity.\n\n\n", "author": "Nomolies", "created": 1763298345859, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "patrioticwinning3", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "", "removal_source": "", "link": "", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Creating policies that lead to a 50-year mortgage term is a good thing, but it is hard to understand if you have not lived with a mortgage for a good stint.", "last_comment_created": 1763358887430, "content": "<p>I suspect many young people (basically, anyone who has never been paying on a mortgage for a good stretch of time) do not understand why a longterm mortgage is not that burdensome.

And more younger citizens will enjoy the benefits of an appreciating asset with monthly loan payments that become smaller and smaller (compared to the economy/cost of living) as time goes on.</p>\n<p>Everyone on PDW who has had a mortgage for a good stint understands these things.</p>\n<p>As I write this post, it occurs to me that the left's goal is not only to bring about historical amnesia (as in Orwell's 1984, when people do not know history it is harder to challenge Big Brother's narrative), but also to make it so that people are unaware of basic strategies for life that everyone used to know.</p>\n<p>A 5-year disruption to our economy was enough to create a huge number of people in their late 20s who have never had the experience of buying (and staying in) a primary residence through financing.  And if enough people are unaware of how it really works with a mortgage, they may fear and oppose the idea of spreading out a loan over a longer term to enable a first-time buyer to stop renting a place he can never own.</p>\n<p>Edit:  I'll just say this as a final comment.  My first mortgage was as long as I could stretch it in time and all I was paying was interest.  The interest rate was horrible.  But I had a house with the mortgage.  When I sold the house, it's sold for twice the amount of the original mortgage.  I sure didn't put much into equity (all mostly interest payments), yet it meant that I had substantial equity when it was time to sell the house.</p>\n<p>President Trump spent his entire life in real estate before becoming president and he knows how it works with appreciating property.  I don't think he was being asinine and clueless when he spoke about 50-year mortgages.  I think he had in mind getting more people to break through the owner vs. renter divide - because the benefits of an appreciating asset start to outweigh the pitiful progress in monthly payments on equity.</p>\n", "score_down": 51, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 354, "score_up": 513, "is_edited":
