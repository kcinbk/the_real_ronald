There are a bunch of videos of him on X right now interacting with them, especially his daughter. She looks about the same age as my daughter.  She happened to come in and I picked her up and kissed her and squeezed her.  I knew right away something was different, and we are not going back, ever, to how things were before. This is a 9/11 type event. You do not go back over the line at this point, not that I thought the Left was ever going to, but this was it.  Charlie Kirk was not an extremist. He was not a politician.  He was not even ultra-conservative.  He was not starting riots, he was not denouncing people.  He was a moderate-conservative who went to talk to people.  He was still killed anyway, in broad daylight.  The media, leftists, even plain liberals, are celebrating this, by the millions.  Not some fringe; a large bulk of them.  Saying he deserved it, dehumanizing him, calling him a bigot, a Nazi, and all the usual things.  I realized, then and there what that means: \r\n\r\n**If they could get away with it, they would do the SAME to you and I**.  Most of us here (and a good chunk of conservatives in general) are to the right of Charlie, and the Left is saying that his views justify killing him.  What would they do to you or I if they could do it?   \r\n\r\nThe other conclusion I came to, is that it is time to get out of liberal states, or states that don't have stand your ground laws.  We are heading down a slope of rapidly normalized violence against conservatives.  The Left is FILLED with mentally-ill individuals.  The leaders of the Left know this. Calling us Nazis, bigots, whatever, is all aimed at the same thing. To dehumanize us.  It's one of the steps in genocide; dehumanize your victims so that the threshold it takes for someone to kill them is lowered. The thing is, we are heading to the point where it's not just the severely mentally ill Leftists that see us as dehumanized enough to murder.  We're heading to the point where the somewhat mentally ill see us as stripped of enough humanity.  That's what leaders on the Left want.  They are going to keep pounding away, stripping away our humanity until practically everyone on the Left sees us as fair game.   The thing is, they have changed the \"definition\" of bigot, Nazi, whatever, so that *now* we actually *do* fit their twisted definition.  Want people to come her legally? Don't want your daughter getting murdered in a locker-room by some guy? Want to go to church and be left in peace?  Those are *part and parcel* with their definition of \"right-wing\" extremism and bigotry which a priori justifies killing you.  This is reality. This is the Left today. \r\n\r\nThe action you have to consider taking, imminently: If you are in a moderately to heavily blue state, it is time to get out.  For your family's sake.  There are some states that have blue cities but the rest is fairly red, but even then, what are the laws around weapons and self-defense?  You need to be able to defend yourself against what comes next. You NEED to be armed, preferably every member of your family, both within your house, and with a daily carry weapon.  Because within a few years, letting slip in public that you're conservative is going to be a potentially deadly mistake.  We are accelerating towards balkanization.  If you can't conceal carry and stand your ground, you're a target where you live.  That's just the sad truth.  You can either get out now, or fight your way out later.  Find a state that is slightly conservative...you migrating there actually has an impact, if enough people do it, the state becomes deep red.  Or find a battleground and go there, you just helped tip the scales.  \r\n\r\nRemember, you were a bigot somehow if you didn't want to jab yourself with an experimental vaccine.  You were a racist if you didn't venerate a drug-dealing fentanyl addict.  You were fired from your jobs if you posted anything about not wanting men leering at your daughter in the locker-room.  These people want you removed from society. Every time they make an excuse for political violence against the Right, like blaming Trump's \"rhetoric\", what are they really saying? Killing conservatives is not THAT bad, there are reasons it can be justified.  What else does that mean? THEY have, within them, in some capacity, the ability to kill someone who is conservative.

Thoughts / Call to Act", "last_comment_created": 1757570828403, "content": "<p>After watching the horrible shit unfold today, I realized he would never again hug his children. There are a bunch of videos of him on X right now interacting with them, especially his daughter. She looks about the same age as my daughter.  She happened to come in and I picked her up and kissed her and squeezed her.  I knew right away something was different, and we are not going back, ever, to how things were before. This is a 9/11 type event. You do not go back over the line at this point, not that I thought the Left was ever going to, but this was it.  Charlie Kirk was not an extremist. He was not a politician.  He was not even ultra-conservative.  He was not starting riots, he was not denouncing people.  He was a moderate-conservative who went to talk to people.  He was still killed anyway, in broad daylight.  The media, leftists, even plain liberals, are celebrating this, by the millions.  Not some fringe; a large bulk of them.  Saying he deserved it, dehumanizing him, calling him a bigot, a Nazi, and all the usual things.  I realized, then and there what that means:</p>\n<p><strong>If they could get away with it, they would do the SAME to you and I</strong>.  Most of us here (and a good chunk of conservatives in general) are to the right of Charlie, and the Left is saying that his views justify killing him.  What would they do to you or I if they could do it?</p>\n<p>The other conclusion I came to, is that it is time to get out of liberal states, or states that don't have stand your ground laws.  We are heading down a slope of rapidly normalized violence against conservatives.  The Left is FILLED with mentally-ill individuals.  The leaders of the Left know this. Calling us Nazis, bigots, whatever, is all aimed at the same thing. To dehumanize us.  It's one of the steps in genocide; dehumanize your victims so that the threshold it takes for someone to kill them is lowered. The thing is, we are heading to the point where it's not just the severely mentally ill Leftists that see us as dehumanized enough to murder.  We're heading to the point where the somewhat mentally ill see us as stripped of enough humanity.  That's what leaders on the Left want.  They are going to keep pounding away, stripping away our humanity until practically everyone on the Left sees us as fair game.   The thing is, they have changed the &quot;definition&quot; of bigot, Nazi, whatever, so that <em>now</em> we actually <em>do</em> fit their twisted definition.  Want people to come her legally? Don't want your daughter getting murdered in a locker-room by some guy? Want to go to church and be left in peace?  Those are <em>part and parcel</em> with their definition of &quot;right-wing&quot; extremism and bigotry which a priori justifies killing you.  This is reality. This is the Left today.</p>\n<p>The action you have to consider taking, imminently: If you are in a moderately to heavily blue state, it is time to get out.  For your family's sake.  There are some states that have blue cities but the rest is fairly red, but even then, what are the laws around weapons and self-defense?  You need to be able to defend yourself against what comes next. You NEED to be armed, preferably every member of your family, both within your house, and with a daily carry weapon.  Because within a few years, letting slip in public that you're conservative is going to be a potentially deadly mistake.  We are accelerating towards balkanization.  If you can't conceal carry and stand your ground, you're a target where you live.  That's just the sad truth.  You can either get out now, or fight your way out later.  Find a state that is slightly conservative...you migrating there actually has an impact, if enough people do it, the state becomes deep red.  Or find a battleground and go there, you just helped tip the scales.</p>\n<p>Remember, you were a bigot somehow if you didn't want to jab yourself with an experimental vaccine.  You were a racist if you didn't venerate a drug-dealing fentanyl addict.  You were fired from your jobs if you posted anything about not wanting men leering at your daughter in the locker-room.  These people want you removed from society. Every time they make an excuse for political violence against the Right, like blaming Trump's &quot;rhetoric&quot;, what are they really saying? Killing conservatives is not THAT bad, there are reasons it can be justified.  What else does that mean? THEY have, within them, in some capacity, the ability to kill someone who is conservative.
