We bombed Iran and now about to start shit with Venezuela. And for what? They are no threat to us. \r\n\r\nHow about draining the swamp? It\u2019s not being drained and it\u2019s as swampy as ever. What happened to all this shit that was supposed to happen after say one. Epstein? He\u2019s a dead guy now so stop asking about him and he\u2019s a Democrat hoax.
