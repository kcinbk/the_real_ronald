Not to forget, some of the TV girls (winnie cooper, blossum) back then went on to become mathematicians and neuroscientists in real life studies.  Anyways, not everyone was a jock or a cheerleader;  there were nerds and couldn't escape their caste (which has also been pounded in the media too), see for example the grim advenures of billy and mandy regarding irwin, south park, &quot;the list&quot;), Nerds were being forcefully and heavily bullied, made fun of, and ostracized everywhere in the media.  They weren't being pushed to become a jock as Vivek avers-although today maybe today the males are being pushed to become female cheerleaders by the groomers. This was to apply extra stress on nerdy people to make them useful tools for society with zero distractions, but also ensure that they were removed from the gene pool. In horticulture stressing plants is often done to cause them to produce a higher yeild as a final reproductive effort. The narrative Vivek was trying to sell the public is not in fact true, the truth is american coders had to work harder to try to achieve the basic human needs that were intentionally deprived to him (being able to interact with others, ending loneliness, more specifically logos or claiming his basic humanity through acceptance of a woman).  Ostracism is very painful <em>for evolutionary reasons</em>, and even the mighty tiger is expect to die quickly when excluded from a pack.  So they were motivated to end this loneliness, that (inability to interact with others, impairs social development, etc) which has become part of the DSM-V diagnotic for autistic spectrum disorders.  However this stress model of obtaining higher yeilds wasn't perfect.  Some may have burned up in the process and quit, others with the mix of ssris (or possibly schizophrenia in teddy's case) have gone violently insane, and others went with the flow.
