all 538 electoral votes on this forum (proof: https://patriots.win/p/199OhuOzI7/my-2024-projections/), so I am going to ride that performance for the next 4 years! Anyway, I will be giving some analysis and future outlooks using the exact same stats I used for the projections. My primary view statistically of presidential elections is two factors: candidate effect (popular vote margin) + state effect (difference between state and national result). I will refer to raw and relative scores, I'll use Alabama as an example. Trump won by 30.471, that is the raw score. He won the popular vote by 1.472, meaning that Alabama's relative score was 28.999 (30.471 - 1.472), which means Alabama voted 28.999 points more Republican that the national popular vote.\n\nFirst of all, Republicans improved in every single state plus DC in terms of raw margin. The only other election in the last 100 years where this occurred was when the Democrats did it in 1976 (additionally the Democrats also improved in every state in 1932, but there were not 50 states yet, nor did DC have any electoral votes).\n\nThere was no landslide! The popular vote margin of 1.472 was the fourth closest in the last 100 years, only 1960, 1968 and 2000 were closer. In terms of electoral votes, Trump's win was more impressive, but it still only ranked 17th out of 25. It was the best Republican electoral performance since 1988 however.\n\nBased on my data, Trump's victory was almost entirely due to his improvement in the national popular vote, and not particularly due to swing states becoming more Republican. The tipping point state (Pennsylvania) had a relative lean of only 0.232, meaning if Trump had lost the popular vote by that much he likely would have lost the election, a huge difference from 2020, where Trump would have likely won if he had gotten a national vote margin of -3.4. This suggests the days of Republicans winning elections without the popular vote (2000 and 2016) may be ending.\n\nAround the time that Trump was officially called the winner on election night, Republicans had a solid lead on 4 senate seats that they eventually lost in very late counting. This suggests the fraud problem was not fixed, instead Trump's win was simply \"Too Big To Rig,\" any smaller and they would have been able to.\n\nStates\n\nAlabama - Republicans won Alabama by at least 20 points in each of the last 6 elections. Trump's 30.471 win was the largest raw score of any election in the state since 1972. Solid red outlook.\n\nAlaska - Republicans won Alaska by double digits for the 8th straight election, however Alaska's relative score was the lowest since 1972. This was the 4th straight election that Alaska shifted bluer in relative score. Outlook is lean red, moving toward a true swing state.\n\nArizona - Republicans reclaimed Arizona with a solid 5.527 victory after Fox News won it in 2020 (called immediately for Democrats, yet ended up being the single closest state in the election?). This was not due to a red shift by Arizona unfortunately, but rather due to Trump's popular vote improvement, because Arizona actually had a very tiny blue shift in relative score. However the blue trend that Arizona had for the last 3 prior elections was slowed significantly, good news for Republicans. Outlook remains a true swing state, with a small red lean.\n\nArkansas - Republicans have improved their raw score in each of the last 8 elections, peaking this past election with a 30.637 win, the largest in the state since 1972. Outlook solid red.\n\nCalifornia - Republicans actually improved for the second straight election, with their best performance since 2004. Still a long way from being competitive. Outlook solid blue.\n\nColorado - No state has taken a larger blue shift during the Trump era than Colorado. Relative score went from only -2.807 in 2016 to -12.457 in 2024. Outlook solid blue, possibly becoming the next Washington or California.\n\nConnecticut - The 8th straight double-digit loss for Republicans in this state. After showing some improvement in 2012 and 2016, the state has regressed to the average poor Republican showing. Outlook solid blue.\n\nDelaware - Republicans had some nice improvement in Delaware in 2016, but those gains were erased. Delaware actually had a higher relative blue score than in 2020, when hometown Biden was the nominee, they liked Harris more than they liked Biden apparently. Outlook solid blue.\n\nDistrict of Columbia - It's DC. Outlook blue until the end of time.\n\nFlorida - The great success story of the Trump era, Florida has gone from a swing state (Trump won by only 1.199 in 2016) to being a Republican stronghold (13.100 in 2024), as Florida remains the fastest growing state in population, likely to add multiple electoral votes in the 2030 census. Outlook moderately solid red.\n\nGeorgia - Republicans reclaimed Georgia, however the blue shift of the state continued unabated, as Georgia moved bluer in relative score for the 5th straight election, with no signs of slowing. Trump's 2024 win (2.192) was less than half of his victory in 2016 in the state (5.131). Outlook remains a true swing state, moving toward blue.\n\nHawaii - Republicans did have their best showing in the state since 2004. Outlook solid blue.\n\nIdaho - The third reddest state in 2024, Trump's 36.492 win was the largest in the state since 2004. Outlook solid red.\n\nIllinois - Republicans had their best raw score in Illinois since 2004, and their best relative score since 2000, however it was still their 9th straight double-digit loss in the state. Outlook solid blue, with a slight red trend.\n\nIndiana - This was one of a handful of midwestern states that showed a moderate blue shift in relative score. Trump's win in 2024 (18.958) was smaller than in 2016 (19.165). Maybe some voters didn't like Trump bashing hometown boy Pence? Outlook still solid red.\n\nIowa - Another of the Trump era's big success stories, Trump's 13.210 victory was the largest in the state since 1972. Trump won the state all 3 times by at least 8 points, after Republicans won the state only 1 time between 1988 and 2012. Outlook moderately solid red.\n\nKansas - Republicans won by double digits for the 8th straight election, but there has been an undeniable blue shift in the state since 2012. Relative score moved bluer all 3 Trump elections, and his 2024 victory (16.116) was smaller than his 2016 win (20.602). Outlook still solid red, for now.\n\nKentucky - Trump's 30.535 win was the largest of anyone in the state in the last 100 years! Outlook solid red.\n\nLouisiana - Republicans won by 22.005, the largest win in the state since 1984. Outlook solid red.\n\nMaine - Trump's performance in 2016 appears to have been an outlier, as a surprisingly close relative score of -0.861 in 2016 dropped significantly to -8.409 by 2024. Trump's 2016 win in the 2nd congressional district (10.288) was higher than his 2024 win (9.046), so even the district he managed to win all 3 times suggests a moderate erosion. Outlook moderately solid blue; district 1 solid blue; district 2 leans red, possibly becoming swing.\n\nMaryland - Republicans lost by double digits for the 9th straight election, with no signs of improvement. Outlook solid blue.\n\nMassachusetts - 2 Republicans have won this state in the last 100 years, Eisenhower and Reagan. It won't happen again anytime soon. Outlook blue as can be.\n\nMichigan - Trump won Michigan (1.414) by less than the popular vote (1.472), meaning the state actually shifted to a blue relative score after having a red one in 2016 and 2020. However, he won Michigan by more than he did Wisconsin, which was quite a surprise to me. Outlook remains a swing state, and will be heavily contested in 2028.\n\nMinnesota - In 2016, Republicans lost Minnesota by only 1.520, and the state actually had a red relative score (meaning they voted more Republican than the national vote) for the only time since 1952! However this appears to have been something of an anomaly, as Trump was not very competitive in the state in 2020 or 2024, and Minnesota actually had a bluer relative score in 2024. It is possible for Republicans to win this state in a true landslide victory. Outlook leans blue.\n\nMississippi - Trump's 22.889 win was the largest in the state since 1984. Outlook solid red.\n\nMissouri - Republicans won their 7th straight election here, however Trump's 2024 win (18.408) was smaller than in 2016 (18.637). Missouri was one of a handful of Midwest states that showed a small blue shift. Outlook still solid red.\n\nMontana - Trump's 2024 win (19.930) was smaller than his 2016 win (20.423), so a small blue shift has occurred in this state, but the state remains uncompetitive. Outlook solid red.\n\nNebraska - Most people would probably look at Trump's 20.460 win and think things went really well in Nebraska, but they would be wrong. There has been a major blue shift in this state over the Trump era, and it could become a problem in the future. Trump won this state by 4.589 fewer points than in 2016, and Nebraska's relative score fell from 27.148 in 2016 to 18.989 in 2024, a major drop. In terms of the congressional districts, the 1st district was the only place in the entire country where Trump had a worse raw performance in 2024 compared to 2020 (though still won by 12.965), and the 2nd district has seemed to completely slip away from Republicans over the last 2 elections, to the point where I would no longer even consider it as swing. Outlook still solid red for now; district 1 still solid red but with a blue trend, district 2 leans blue, and district 3 is the reddest electoral vote in the entire country.\n\nNevada - The long term improvement in Nevada, one of the fastest growing states, has been a major success story for Republicans. They improved their raw performance in each of the last 4 elections, and finally won in 2024, the only state Trump won in 2024 that he did not also win in 2016. Outlook swing state with a red trend.\n\nNew Hampshire - Trump nearly won this state in 2016 (losing by only 0.368), but similar to Maine, a lot of that surprise performance seems to have been temporary. New Hampshire is winnable in a landslide year. Outlook swing state that leans blue.\n\nNew Jersey - Republicans have made significant headway in New Jersey, having their best performance in the state since 1992, as Trump shifted the state 10.028 points to the right from 2020, the second largest improvement in the country in 2024. It remains to be seen whether the state continues to move toward swing state status, but it has had a higher relative score in each of the last 3 elections. Outlook leans blue, possibly moving toward swing status.\n\nNew Mexico - Trump did have the Republican party's best performance in the state since 2004, but little relative movement has occurred in this state since 2008. Outlook leans blue.\n\nNew York - No state in 2024 moved more to the right than New York, with an improvement of 10.537. Trump's loss margin of only 12.591 was the best Republican performance since 1988. However, New York is still far from a competitive state. Outlook still solid blue.\n\nNorth Carolina - This is me sounding a massive alarm for Republicans in this state. This used to be a moderate lean red state, now it is a true swing state. Trump won by less in 2024 (3.212) than in 2016 (3.655) despite the massive failures of the Democrat-led White House to help people during the flooding disaster. North Carolina has shifted bluer in relative score in 5 of the last 6 elections. I worry this state is slipping away, and it is not a small number of electoral votes. Outlook true swing state.\n\nNorth Dakota - This was the 4th reddest state in 2024, and Trump's 36.446 win was the largest in the state since 1980. Outlook solid red.\n\nOhio - Another of the great successes of the Trump era, Ohio went from being the prototypical swing state for nearly 100 years into a solid red state, and his 2024 victory of 11.207 was the highest in the state since 1984. Outlook moderately solid red.\n\nOklahoma - Republicans had their 7th straight win of over 20 points. Outlook solid red.\n\nOregon - Republicans lost by double digits for the 5th straight election, and for the 10th straight time overall. Even worse was the relative score (-15.779), Oregon's bluest score in the last 100 years. Outlook solid blue.\n\nPennsylvania - The biggest prize on the board in 2024, the tipping point state. Trump's slim 1.704 victory was nonetheless the largest Republican win since 1988. Pennsylvania voted relatively red all 3 times in the Trump era, after 16 straight elections with a relative blue score. Expect this state to remain the most hotly contested state in 2028. Outlook true swing state.\n\nRhode Island - Unlike Connecticut and Delaware, there are at least some positive trends in this state. Raw margin has been cut from -27.457 in 2012 to -13.781 in 2024, which was the best Republican finish in the state since 1988. Outlook still solid blue.\n\nSouth Carolina - Trump's 17.868 win was the largest in the state since 1988. Outlook solid red.\n\nSouth Dakota - The 15th straight win for Republicans, although Trump's 2024 win (29.195) was slightly lower than in 2016 (29.793). Outlook solid red.\n\nTennessee - Trump's 29.720 win was the largest in the state since 1972. Outlook solid red.\n\nTexas - After large declines in both of Trump's previous elections, Texas finally got on board the MAGA agenda and delivered the Republicans a comfortable 13.683 win. Despite concerted efforts by Democrats in this state, Texas remains reliably red for now. Outlook moderately solid red.\n\nUtah - 2024 was the 15th straight election that republicans won by at least 18 points. Outlook solid red.\n\nVermont - The bluest state on the board, Vermont had it's bluest relative score in the last 100 years. Outlook blue.\n\nVirginia - Hope for a red shift in this state after the surprise election of Youngkin at governor was dashed, as Trump lost the state by a larger margin in 2024 (-5.766) than in 2016 (-5.321). Virginia has actually become relatively bluer in each of the past 7 elections. Despite this the state remains winnable in a landslide scenario. Outlook leans blue.\n\nWashington - Though all 50 states saw a raw Republican improvement in 2024, Washington saw the smallest, so in other words, no state shifted more relatively blue than this one. Yuck. Outlook solid blue.\n\nWest Virginia - The 2nd reddest state in 2024. Outlook solid red.\n\nWisconsin - Although Trump won this state, it was his smallest margin of victory (0.859), and had a relative blue shift of 4.442. Previously this state was showing signs of becoming a reliable red state. Trump was winning by significantly more prior to late counting, and I believe that a large amount of mail-in fraud occurred late in the night in order to steal the senate seat. Outlook true swing state.\n\nWyoming - The reddest state in the country.

Anyway, I will be giving some analysis and future outlooks using the exact same stats I used for the projections. My primary view statistically of presidential elections is two factors: candidate effect (popular vote margin) + state effect (difference between state and national result). I will refer to raw and relative scores, I'll use Alabama as an example. Trump won by 30.471, that is the raw score. He won the popular vote by 1.472, meaning that Alabama's relative score was 28.999 (30.471 - 1.472), which means Alabama voted 28.999 points more Republican that the national popular vote.</p>\n<p>First of all, Republicans improved in every single state plus DC in terms of raw margin. The only other election in the last 100 years where this occurred was when the Democrats did it in 1976 (additionally the Democrats also improved in every state in 1932, but there were not 50 states yet, nor did DC have any electoral votes).</p>\n<p>There was no landslide! The popular vote margin of 1.472 was the fourth closest in the last 100 years, only 1960, 1968 and 2000 were closer. In terms of electoral votes, Trump's win was more impressive, but it still only ranked 17th out of 25. It was the best Republican electoral performance since 1988 however.</p>\n<p>Based on my data, Trump's victory was almost entirely due to his improvement in the national popular vote, and not particularly due to swing states becoming more Republican. The tipping point state (Pennsylvania) had a relative lean of only 0.232, meaning if Trump had lost the popular vote by that much he likely would have lost the election, a huge difference from 2020, where Trump would have likely won if he had gotten a national vote margin of -3.4. This suggests the days of Republicans winning elections without the popular vote (2000 and 2016) may be ending.</p>\n<p>Around the time that Trump was officially called the winner on election night, Republicans had a solid lead on 4 senate seats that they eventually lost in very late counting. This suggests the fraud problem was not fixed, instead Trump's win was simply &quot;Too Big To Rig,&quot; any smaller and they would have been able to.</p>\n<p>States</p>\n<p>Alabama - Republicans won Alabama by at least 20 points in each of the last 6 elections. Trump's 30.471 win was the largest raw score of any election in the state since 1972. Solid red outlook.</p>\n<p>Alaska - Republicans won Alaska by double digits for the 8th straight election, however Alaska's relative score was the lowest since 1972. This was the 4th straight election that Alaska shifted bluer in relative score. Outlook is lean red, moving toward a true swing state.</p>\n<p>Arizona - Republicans reclaimed Arizona with a solid 5.527 victory after Fox News won it in 2020 (called immediately for Democrats, yet ended up being the single closest state in the election?). This was not due to a red shift by Arizona unfortunately, but rather due to Trump's popular vote improvement, because Arizona actually had a very tiny blue shift in relative score. However the blue trend that Arizona had for the last 3 prior elections was slowed significantly, good news for Republicans. Outlook remains a true swing state, with a small red lean.</p>\n<p>Arkansas - Republicans have improved their raw score in each of the last 8 elections, peaking this past election with a 30.637 win, the largest in the state since 1972. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>California - Republicans actually improved for the second straight election, with their best performance since 2004. Still a long way from being competitive. Outlook solid blue.</p>\n<p>Colorado - No state has taken a larger blue shift during the Trump era than Colorado. Relative score went from only -2.807 in 2016 to -12.457 in 2024. Outlook solid blue, possibly becoming the next Washington or California.</p>\n<p>Connecticut - The 8th straight double-digit loss for Republicans in this state. After showing some improvement in 2012 and 2016, the state has regressed to the average poor Republican showing. Outlook solid blue.</p>\n<p>Delaware - Republicans had some nice improvement in Delaware in 2016, but those gains were erased. Delaware actually had a higher relative blue score than in 2020, when hometown Biden was the nominee, they liked Harris more than they liked Biden apparently. Outlook solid blue.</p>\n<p>District of Columbia - It's DC. Outlook blue until the end of time.</p>\n<p>Florida - The great success story of the Trump era, Florida has gone from a swing state (Trump won by only 1.199 in 2016) to being a Republican stronghold (13.100 in 2024), as Florida remains the fastest growing state in population, likely to add multiple electoral votes in the 2030 census. Outlook moderately solid red.</p>\n<p>Georgia - Republicans reclaimed Georgia, however the blue shift of the state continued unabated, as Georgia moved bluer in relative score for the 5th straight election, with no signs of slowing. Trump's 2024 win (2.192) was less than half of his victory in 2016 in the state (5.131). Outlook remains a true swing state, moving toward blue.</p>\n<p>Hawaii - Republicans did have their best showing in the state since 2004. Outlook solid blue.</p>\n<p>Idaho - The third reddest state in 2024, Trump's 36.492 win was the largest in the state since 2004. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Illinois - Republicans had their best raw score in Illinois since 2004, and their best relative score since 2000, however it was still their 9th straight double-digit loss in the state. Outlook solid blue, with a slight red trend.</p>\n<p>Indiana - This was one of a handful of midwestern states that showed a moderate blue shift in relative score. Trump's win in 2024 (18.958) was smaller than in 2016 (19.165). Maybe some voters didn't like Trump bashing hometown boy Pence? Outlook still solid red.</p>\n<p>Iowa - Another of the Trump era's big success stories, Trump's 13.210 victory was the largest in the state since 1972. Trump won the state all 3 times by at least 8 points, after Republicans won the state only 1 time between 1988 and 2012. Outlook moderately solid red.</p>\n<p>Kansas - Republicans won by double digits for the 8th straight election, but there has been an undeniable blue shift in the state since 2012. Relative score moved bluer all 3 Trump elections, and his 2024 victory (16.116) was smaller than his 2016 win (20.602). Outlook still solid red, for now.</p>\n<p>Kentucky - Trump's 30.535 win was the largest of anyone in the state in the last 100 years! Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Louisiana - Republicans won by 22.005, the largest win in the state since 1984. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Maine - Trump's performance in 2016 appears to have been an outlier, as a surprisingly close relative score of -0.861 in 2016 dropped significantly to -8.409 by 2024. Trump's 2016 win in the 2nd congressional district (10.288) was higher than his 2024 win (9.046), so even the district he managed to win all 3 times suggests a moderate erosion. Outlook moderately solid blue; district 1 solid blue; district 2 leans red, possibly becoming swing.</p>\n<p>Maryland - Republicans lost by double digits for the 9th straight election, with no signs of improvement. Outlook solid blue.</p>\n<p>Massachusetts - 2 Republicans have won this state in the last 100 years, Eisenhower and Reagan. It won't happen again anytime soon. Outlook blue as can be.</p>\n<p>Michigan - Trump won Michigan (1.414) by less than the popular vote (1.472), meaning the state actually shifted to a blue relative score after having a red one in 2016 and 2020. However, he won Michigan by more than he did Wisconsin, which was quite a surprise to me. Outlook remains a swing state, and will be heavily contested in 2028.</p>\n<p>Minnesota - In 2016, Republicans lost Minnesota by only 1.520, and the state actually had a red relative score (meaning they voted more Republican than the national vote) for the only time since 1952! However this appears to have been something of an anomaly, as Trump was not very competitive in the state in 2020 or 2024, and Minnesota actually had a bluer relative score in 2024. It is possible for Republicans to win this state in a true landslide victory. Outlook leans blue.</p>\n<p>Mississippi - Trump's 22.889 win was the largest in the state since 1984. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Missouri - Republicans won their 7th straight election here, however Trump's 2024 win (18.408) was smaller than in 2016 (18.637). Missouri was one of a handful of Midwest states that showed a small blue shift. Outlook still solid red.</p>\n<p>Montana - Trump's 2024 win (19.930) was smaller than his 2016 win (20.423), so a small blue shift has occurred in this state, but the state remains uncompetitive. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Nebraska - Most people would probably look at Trump's 20.460 win and think things went really well in Nebraska, but they would be wrong. There has been a major blue shift in this state over the Trump era, and it could become a problem in the future. Trump won this state by 4.589 fewer points than in 2016, and Nebraska's relative score fell from 27.148 in 2016 to 18.989 in 2024, a major drop. In terms of the congressional districts, the 1st district was the only place in the entire country where Trump had a worse raw performance in 2024 compared to 2020 (though still won by 12.965), and the 2nd district has seemed to completely slip away from Republicans over the last 2 elections, to the point where I would no longer even consider it as swing. Outlook still solid red for now; district 1 still solid red but with a blue trend, district 2 leans blue, and district 3 is the reddest electoral vote in the entire country.</p>\n<p>Nevada - The long term improvement in Nevada, one of the fastest growing states, has been a major success story for Republicans. They improved their raw performance in each of the last 4 elections, and finally won in 2024, the only state Trump won in 2024 that he did not also win in 2016. Outlook swing state with a red trend.</p>\n<p>New Hampshire - Trump nearly won this state in 2016 (losing by only 0.368), but similar to Maine, a lot of that surprise performance seems to have been temporary. New Hampshire is winnable in a landslide year. Outlook swing state that leans blue.</p>\n<p>New Jersey - Republicans have made significant headway in New Jersey, having their best performance in the state since 1992, as Trump shifted the state 10.028 points to the right from 2020, the second largest improvement in the country in 2024. It remains to be seen whether the state continues to move toward swing state status, but it has had a higher relative score in each of the last 3 elections. Outlook leans blue, possibly moving toward swing status.</p>\n<p>New Mexico - Trump did have the Republican party's best performance in the state since 2004, but little relative movement has occurred in this state since 2008. Outlook leans blue.</p>\n<p>New York - No state in 2024 moved more to the right than New York, with an improvement of 10.537. Trump's loss margin of only 12.591 was the best Republican performance since 1988. However, New York is still far from a competitive state. Outlook still solid blue.</p>\n<p>North Carolina - This is me sounding a massive alarm for Republicans in this state. This used to be a moderate lean red state, now it is a true swing state. Trump won by less in 2024 (3.212) than in 2016 (3.655) despite the massive failures of the Democrat-led White House to help people during the flooding disaster. North Carolina has shifted bluer in relative score in 5 of the last 6 elections. I worry this state is slipping away, and it is not a small number of electoral votes. Outlook true swing state.</p>\n<p>North Dakota - This was the 4th reddest state in 2024, and Trump's 36.446 win was the largest in the state since 1980. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Ohio - Another of the great successes of the Trump era, Ohio went from being the prototypical swing state for nearly 100 years into a solid red state, and his 2024 victory of 11.207 was the highest in the state since 1984. Outlook moderately solid red.</p>\n<p>Oklahoma - Republicans had their 7th straight win of over 20 points. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Oregon - Republicans lost by double digits for the 5th straight election, and for the 10th straight time overall. Even worse was the relative score (-15.779), Oregon's bluest score in the last 100 years. Outlook solid blue.</p>\n<p>Pennsylvania - The biggest prize on the board in 2024, the tipping point state. Trump's slim 1.704 victory was nonetheless the largest Republican win since 1988. Pennsylvania voted relatively red all 3 times in the Trump era, after 16 straight elections with a relative blue score. Expect this state to remain the most hotly contested state in 2028. Outlook true swing state.</p>\n<p>Rhode Island - Unlike Connecticut and Delaware, there are at least some positive trends in this state. Raw margin has been cut from -27.457 in 2012 to -13.781 in 2024, which was the best Republican finish in the state since 1988. Outlook still solid blue.</p>\n<p>South Carolina - Trump's 17.868 win was the largest in the state since 1988. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>South Dakota - The 15th straight win for Republicans, although Trump's 2024 win (29.195) was slightly lower than in 2016 (29.793). Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Tennessee - Trump's 29.720 win was the largest in the state since 1972. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Texas - After large declines in both of Trump's previous elections, Texas finally got on board the MAGA agenda and delivered the Republicans a comfortable 13.683 win. Despite concerted efforts by Democrats in this state, Texas remains reliably red for now. Outlook moderately solid red.</p>\n<p>Utah - 2024 was the 15th straight election that republicans won by at least 18 points. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Vermont - The bluest state on the board, Vermont had it's bluest relative score in the last 100 years. Outlook blue.</p>\n<p>Virginia - Hope for a red shift in this state after the surprise election of Youngkin at governor was dashed, as Trump lost the state by a larger margin in 2024 (-5.766) than in 2016 (-5.321). Virginia has actually become relatively bluer in each of the past 7 elections. Despite this the state remains winnable in a landslide scenario. Outlook leans blue.</p>\n<p>Washington - Though all 50 states saw a raw Republican improvement in 2024, Washington saw the smallest, so in other words, no state shifted more relatively blue than this one. Yuck. Outlook solid blue.</p>\n<p>West Virginia - The 2nd reddest state in 2024. Outlook solid red.</p>\n<p>Wisconsin - Although Trump won this state, it was his smallest margin of victory (0.859), and had a relative blue shift of 4.442. Previously this state was showing signs of becoming a reliable red state. Trump was winning by significantly more prior to late counting, and I believe that a large amount of mail-in fraud occurred late in the night in order to steal the senate seat. Outlook true swing state.</p>\n<p>Wyoming - The reddest state in the country. Outlook solid red.</p>\n", "score_down": 1, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 0, "score_up": 53, "is_edited": true, "is_moderator": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "archive_id": ""}, {"is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "1921008536940933279", "sticky_comment": 0, "is_video_mp4": false, "type": "link", "uuid": "19BGAmnS4H", "is_twitter": true, "is_admin": false, "score": 91, "suggested_sort": 0, "post_flair_class": "", "id": 7707661, "raw_content": "", "author": "KuzoKevin", "created": 1746845296623, "profile_picture": "", "community": "TheDonald", "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "TwoArizonaPedes", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "domain": "twitter.com", "is_crosspost": false, "preview": "https://media.scored.co/preview/19BGAmnS4H.png", "removal_source": "", "link": "https://twitter.com/TheAtlasSociety/status/1921008536940933279", "author_flair_class": "", "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "\"They're cry bullies.\"", "last_comment_created": 1746857127762, "content": "", "score_down": 1, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "comments": 8, "score_up": 92, "is_edited": false, "is_moderator": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "link_metadata": {"twitter": {"quotedTweet": false, "images": false, "linkEmbed": false, "replies": 5, "created": 1746839100000, "id": "1921008536940933279", "video": false, "poll": false, "user": {"profilePicture": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1611520891409813504/bibf3Qs3_normal.jpg", "displayName": "The Atlas Society", "username": "TheAtlasSociety"}, "content": "Ayn Rand, going back to this theme of valorizing weakness, would have hated Hamas.
