It is also the perspective of most of the people at the Capitol on 1/6, and probably even Trump himself. 1/x</p>\n<p>Most believe some or all of the theories involving midnight ballots, voting machines, etc, but what you find when you talk to them is that, while they\u2019ll defend those positions w/info they got from Hannity or Breitbart or whatever, they\u2019re not particularly attached to them. 2/x</p>\n<p>Here are the facts \u2013 actual, confirmed facts \u2013 that shape their perspective: 1) The FBI/etc spied on the 2016 Trump campaign using evidence manufactured by the Clinton campaign. We now know that all involved knew it was fake from Day 1 (see: Brennan\u2019s July 2016 memo, etc). 3/x</p>\n<p>These are Tea Party people. The types who give their kids a pocket Constitution for their birthday and have Founding Fathers memes in their bios. The intel community spying on a presidential campaign using fake evidence (incl forged documents) is a big deal to them. 4/x</p>\n<p>Everyone involved lied about their involvement as long as they could. We only learned the DNC paid for the manufactured evidence because of a court order. Comey denied on TV knowing the DNC paid for it, when we have emails from a year earlier proving that he knew. 5/x</p>\n<p>This was true with everyone, from CIA Dir Brennan &amp; Adam Schiff \u2013 who were on TV saying they\u2019d seen clear evidence of collusion w/Russia, while admitting under oath behind closed doors that they hadn\u2019t \u2013 all the way down the line. In the end we learned that it was ALL fake. 6/x</p>\n<p>At first, many Trump ppl were worried there must be some collusion, because every media &amp; intel agency wouldn\u2019t make it up out of nothing. When it was clear that they had made it up, people expected a reckoning, and shed many illusions about their gov\u2019t when it didn\u2019t happen. 7/x</p>\n<p>We know as fact: a) The Steele dossier was the sole evidence used to justify spying on the Trump campaign, b) The FBI knew the Steele dossier was a DNC op, c) Steele\u2019s source told the FBI the info was unserious, d) they did not inform the court of any of this and kept spying. 8/x</p>\n<p>Trump supporters know the collusion case front and back. They went from worrying the collusion must be real, to suspecting it might be fake, to realizing it was a scam, then watched as every institution \u2013 agencies, the press, Congress, academia \u2013 gaslit them for another year. 9/x</p>\n<p>Worse, collusion was used to scare people away from working in the administration. They knew their entire lives would be investigated. Many quit because they were being bankrupted by legal fees. The DoJ, press, &amp; gov\u2019t destroyed lives and actively subverted an elected admin. 10/x</p>\n<p>This is where people whose political identity was largely defined by a naive belief in what they learned in Civics class began to see the outline of a Regime that crossed all institutional boundaries. Because it had stepped out of the shadows to unite against an interloper. 11/x</p>\n<p>GOP propaganda still has many of them thinking in terms of partisan binaries, but A LOT of Trump supporters see that the Regime is not partisan. They all know that the same institutions would have taken opposite sides if it was a Tulsi Gabbard vs Jeb Bush election. 12/x</p>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to describe to people on the left (who are used to thinking of gov\u2019t as a conspiracy\u2026 Watergate, COINTELPRO, WMD, etc) how shocking &amp; disillusioning this was for people who encourage their sons to enlist in the Army, and hate ppl who don\u2019t stand for the Anthem. 13/x</p>\n<p>They could have managed the shock if it only involved the government. But the behavior of the corporate press is really what radicalized them. They hate journalists more than they hate any politician or gov\u2019t official, because they feel most betrayed by them. 14/x</p>\n<p>The idea that the press is driven by ratings/sensationalism became untenable. If that were true, they\u2019d be all over the Epstein story. The corporate press is the propaganda arm of the Regime they now see in outline. Nothing anyone says will ever make them unsee that, period. 15/x</p>\n<p>This is profoundly disorienting. Many of them don\u2019t know for certain whether ballots were faked in November 2020, but they know for absolute certain that the press, the FBI, etc would lie to them if there was. They have every reason to believe that, and it\u2019s probably true. 16/x</p>\n<p>They watched the press behave like animals for four years. Tens of millions of people will always see Kavanaugh as a gang rapist, based on nothing, because of CNN. And CNN seems proud of that. They led a lynch mob against a high school kid. They cheered on a summer of riots. 17/x</p>\n<p>They always claimed the media had liberal bias, fine, whatever. They still thought the press would admit truth if they were cornered. Now they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a different thing to watch them invent stories whole cloth in order to destroy regular lives and spark mass violence. 18/x</p>\n<p>Time Mag told us that during the 2020 riots, there were weekly conference calls involving, among others, leaders of the protests, the local officials who refused to stop them, and media people who framed them for political effect. In Ukraine we call that a color revolution. 19/x</p>\n<p>Throughout the summer, Democrat governors took advantage of COVID to change voting procedures. It wasn\u2019t just the mail-ins (they lowered signature matching standards, etc). After the collusion scam, the fake impeachment, Trump ppl expected shenanigans by now. 20/x</p>\n<p>Re: \u201cfake impeachment\u201d, we now know that Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to cooperate w/the DOJ regarding Biden\u2019s $ activities in Ukraine was in support of an active investigation being pursued by the FBI and Ukraine AG at the time, and so a completely legitimate request. 21/x</p>\n<p>Then you get the Hunter laptop scandal. Big Tech ran a full-on censorship campaign against a major newspaper to protect a political candidate. Period. Everyone knows it, all of the Tech companies now admit it was a \u201cmistake\u201d \u2013 but, ya know, the election\u2019s over, so who cares? 22/x</p>\n<p>Goes w/o saying, but: If the NY Times had Don Jr\u2019s laptop, full of pics of him smoking crack and engaging in group sex, lots of lurid family drama, emails describing direct corruption and backed up by the CEO of the company they were using, the NYT wouldn\u2019t have been banned. 23/x</p>\n<p>Think back: Stories about Trump being pissed on by Russian prostitutes and blackmailed by Putin were promoted as fact, and the only evidence was a document paid for by his opposition and disavowed by its source. The NY Post was banned for reporting on true information. 24/x</p>\n<p>The reaction of Trump ppl to all this was not, \u201cno fair!\u201d That\u2019s how they felt about Romney\u2019s \u201cbinders of women\u201d in 2012. This is different. Now they see, correctly, that every institution is captured by ppl who will use any means to exclude them from the political process. 25/x</p>\n<p>And yet they showed up in record numbers to vote. He got 13m more votes than in 2016, 10m more than Clinton got! As election night dragged on, they allowed themselves some hope. But when the four critical swing states (and only those states) went dark at midnight, they knew. 26/x</p>\n<p>Over the ensuing weeks, they got shuffled around by grifters and media scam artists selling them conspiracy theories. They latched onto one, then another increasingly absurd theory as they tried to put a concrete name on something very real. 27/x</p>\n<p>Media &amp; Tech did everything to make things worse. Everything about the election was strange \u2013 the changes to procedure, unprecedented mail-in voting, the delays, etc \u2013 but rather than admit that and make everything transparent, they banned discussion of it (even in DMs!). 28/x</p>\n<p>Everyone knows that, just as Don Jr\u2019s laptop would\u2019ve been the story of the century, if everything about the election dispute was the same, except the parties were reversed, suspicions about the outcome would\u2019ve been Taken Very Seriously. See 2016 for proof. 29/x</p>\n<p>Even the courts\u2019 refusal of the case gets nowhere w/them, because of how the opposition embraced mass political violence.

Sure, they were \u201cprotests\u201d, but they were planned by the same people as during the summer, and everyone knows what it would have meant. Judges have families, too. 31/x</p>\n<p>Forget the ballot conspiracies. It\u2019s a fact that governors used COVID to unconstitutionally alter election procedures (the Constitution states that only legislatures can do so) to help Biden to make up for a massive enthusiasm gap by gaming the mail-in ballot system. 32/x</p>\n<p>They knew it was unconstitutional, it\u2019s right there in plain English. But they knew the cases wouldn\u2019t see court until after the election. And what judge will toss millions of ballots because a governor broke the rules? The threat of mass riots wasn\u2019t implied, it was direct. 33/x</p>\n<p>a) The entrenched bureaucracy &amp; security state subverted Trump from Day 1, b) The press is part of the operation, c) Election rules were changed, d) Big Tech censors opposition, e) Political violence is legitimized &amp; encouraged, f) Trump is banned from social media. 34/x</p>\n<p>They were led down some rabbit holes, but they are absolutely right that their gov\u2019t is monopolized by a Regime that believes they are beneath representation, and will observe no limits to keep them getting it.

It is also the perspective of most of the people at the Capitol on 1/6, and probably even Trump himself. 1/x\n\nMost believe some or all of the theories involving midnight ballots, voting machines, etc, but what you find when you talk to them is that, while they\u2019ll defend those positions w/info they got from Hannity or Breitbart or whatever, they\u2019re not particularly attached to them. 2/x\n\nHere are the facts \u2013 actual, confirmed facts \u2013 that shape their perspective: 1) The FBI/etc spied on the 2016 Trump campaign using evidence manufactured by the Clinton campaign. We now know that all involved knew it was fake from Day 1 (see: Brennan\u2019s July 2016 memo, etc). 3/x\n\nThese are Tea Party people. The types who give their kids a pocket Constitution for their birthday and have Founding Fathers memes in their bios. The intel community spying on a presidential campaign using fake evidence (incl forged documents) is a big deal to them. 4/x\n\nEveryone involved lied about their involvement as long as they could.
