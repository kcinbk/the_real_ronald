Not something I would do but ok.  Go have fun.   Well my Mom meets up on the first day with this other outspoken loud liberal lady.  They start singing commie songs, you know Neil Diamond There Coming to America.  I just start to laugh and I already know where this is going.  She said on day two they told us we could no longer talk loudly or sing or talk politics and they made new seating assignments and they separated the two liberals.......lol.   My mom ended up on a bus of Trumpsters and was put in her place.  She said she just stayed quiet the rest of the trip.  Everyone else got to be loud and have fun.  It wasn't fair.</p>\n<p>Then the conflict begins.  We start talking medicine and she is boosted tot he hilt and yep you guessed it.  Sick a lot.  She's on everything under the sun.  We talk about all the alcoholics we know in the final stages of drinking themselves to death.  Many in my family, extended.</p>\n<p>We start talking about how she couldn't understand how some parents favored one child over the others in a will.  My BIL has a dad about to die from alcoholism.  His daughter got the house and the rest got nothing.  I said you think thats not fair, wait until Kamala taxes you on unrealized gains and the inheritance tax skyrockets.   You wont be leaving shit for your kids.  But the government thanks you.</p>\n<p>Then it goes political and it goes fast.   So I ask her if she likes Kennedy.  Hates him.  Dogs and cats comes up.  Says it's fake.  I explain to her it is not.  I said it is probably overblown but in Haiti they practice witchcraft and voodoo.  They use these animals for ritual sacrifice, drink the blood, eat the meat and use the bones in witchcraft.  You can not even deny that this stuff doesn't happen in the third world and we are importing the third world.  OOOH she didn't like that.</p>\n<p>She was talking over me trying hard to come up with the most petty but Trump shit.  And I am like this is what you are focusing on?  I said, in the debate.  How did the moderators know Trump was gonna bring up Springfield and eating dogs and cats.  And the moderators called a city official and they debunked it in real time. To my knowledge he never mentioned eating dogs and cats before then.  I may be wrong,  I said mom, 1500 people tell you it's happening.  One person says it isn't and you believe it.  &quot;There is no proof. &quot; Then she tells me about the fake cat eating video where a woman had fur on her lips.  I said that wasn't from Springfield but I am pretty sure it was real.   No it's not.Somehow that turned into Trump was gonna hang Pence.  I said, he never said anything like that.    Then she snapped back......he didn't deny saying it either?  I said where the hell are you getting your news.  I really want to know?  Of course she doesn't tell me.</p>\n<p>Ends with I could never ever support any group of people that break down doors and burn down buildings and threaten to murder and beat cops and hang people.   I could never support those very fine people and I instantly got confused.  I said hold up what event are we talking about?  I am thinking BLM or Charlotsville.   Nope JAN 6th.  They broke into the capital and were tryng to murder people.   I said mom those doors were opened from the inside.  Nancy Pelosi was the only one that was in charge of that.  It was her and her goons.   Well she is so confused she has all those events happening as Jan 6th and he did nothing to stop it.  I said he put out a video on twitter and twitter took it down almost instantly.  No he didn't.</p>\n<p>She said I get my information from those questionable websites and fox.  Said Mom nope, haven't turned on fox news in six years.  And who is telling you my news sources are questionable?  The mainstream media?  The ones owned by seven corporations and many foreign owned media?  The ones paid by big pharma to lie and get our population hooked on drugs?  Who gives them credibility?   I said Mom, the truth is gonna come out.  Everyone is gonna know what happened.  She then says well your dad and I will only be alive another four years or so and it is you and your kids that will have to live with the ramifications of Donald Trump.

We talk about all the alcoholics we know in the final stages of drinking themselves to death.  Many in my family, extended. \n\n \nWe start talking about how she couldn't understand how some parents favored one child over the others in a will.  My BIL has a dad about to die from alcoholism.  His daughter got the house and the rest got nothing.  I said you think thats not fair, wait until Kamala taxes you on unrealized gains and the inheritance tax skyrockets.   You wont be leaving shit for your kids.  But the government thanks you. \n\nThen it goes political and it goes fast.   So I ask her if she likes Kennedy.  Hates him.  Dogs and cats comes up.  Says it's fake.  I explain to her it is not.  I said it is probably overblown but in Haiti they practice witchcraft and voodoo.  They use these animals for ritual sacrifice, drink the blood, eat the meat and use the bones in witchcraft.  You can not even deny that this stuff doesn't happen in the third world and we are importing the third world.  OOOH she didn't like that.    \n\n She was talking over me trying hard to come up with the most petty but Trump shit.  And I am like this is what you are focusing on?  I said, in the debate.  How did the moderators know Trump was gonna bring up Springfield and eating dogs and cats.  And the moderators called a city official and they debunked it in real time. To my knowledge he never mentioned eating dogs and cats before then.  I may be wrong,  I said mom, 1500 people tell you it's happening.  One person says it isn't and you believe it.  \"There is no proof. \" Then she tells me about the fake cat eating video where a woman had fur on her lips.  I said that wasn't from Springfield but I am pretty sure it was real.   No it's not.Somehow that turned into Trump was gonna hang Pence.  I said, he never said anything like that.    Then she snapped back......he didn't deny saying it either?  I said where the hell are you getting your news.  I really want to know?  Of course she doesn't tell me.  \n\nEnds with I could never ever support any group of people that break down doors and burn down buildings and threaten to murder and beat cops and hang people.   I could never support those very fine people and I instantly got confused.  I said hold up what event are we talking about?  I am thinking BLM or Charlotsville.   Nope JAN 6th.  They broke into the capital and were tryng to murder people.   I said mom those doors were opened from the inside.  Nancy Pelosi was the only one that was in charge of that.  It was her and her goons.   Well she is so confused she has all those events happening as Jan 6th and he did nothing to stop it.  I said he put out a video on twitter and twitter took it down almost instantly.  No he didn't.\n\nShe said I get my information from those questionable websites and fox.  Said Mom nope, haven't turned on fox news in six years.  And who is telling you my news sources are questionable?  The mainstream media?  The ones owned by seven corporations and many foreign owned media?  The ones paid by big pharma to lie and get our population hooked on drugs?  Who gives them credibility?   I said Mom, the truth is gonna come out.  Everyone is gonna know what happened.  She then says well your dad and I will only be alive another four years or so and it is you and your kids that will have to live with the ramifications of Donald Trump.   Absolutely!!!!\n\n", "comments": 46, "author": "3333333", "created": 1726606176301, "score_up": 91, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "3333333", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.patriots.win/preview/1994yPag0O.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://media.scored.co/post/wLgz3YiJpgeB.png", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [{"reference": "/scale/XtPn1ljy569Kj7Zb.png", "width": 768, "content-type": "png", "height": 304}], "blurhash": "U3P?:j?^~W_N009F-;4n00?w4T%#009F%M9G", "full_resolution": [499, 1259]}, "title": "Definitely a Walz supporter - This is real BTW", "type": "link", "last_comment_created": 1726618932912, "uuid": "1994yPag0O", "content": "", "score_down": 0, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 61, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": true, "id": 7049170, "raw_content": "", "comments": 6, "author": "schism", "created": 1726613857802, "score_up": 61, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "CovfefeVideo", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "media.scored.co", "link_metadata": {"status": 200}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.patriots.win/preview/1994yPag8l.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "1836178999178866766", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://twitter.com/GrageDustin/status/1836178999178866766", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Well lookie there!  - Springfield  City Manager acknowledging complaints of domestic animals being eaten.", "type": "link", "last_comment_created": 1726619997871, "uuid": "1994yPag8l", "content": "", "score_down": 0, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": true, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 63, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "id": 7049197, "raw_content": "", "comments": 1, "author": "schism", "created": 1726614795511, "score_up": 63, "profile_picture": "", "is_edited": false, "community": "TheDonald", "is_moderator": false, "ad_tier": 2, "last_comment_author": "Covidrrhea", "is_video": false, "video_link": "", "is_new_user": false, "awards": 0, "vote_state": 2, "domain": "twitter.com", "link_metadata": {"twitter": {"quotedTweet": false, "images": false, "linkEmbed": false, "replies": 6, "created": 1726614162000, "id": "1836178999178866766", "video": {"preview": "https://pbs.twimg.com/amplify_video_thumb/1836178655287848960/img/s7LXd-yERMU0ttzx.jpg", "mpeg": "https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1836178655287848960/pl/WwNQ-PaLE3Ldk5U5.m3u8?tag=16", "aspectRatio": [148, 83], "heightRatio": 56, "type": "video/mp4", "url": "https://video.twimg.com/amplify_video/1836178655287848960/vid/avc1/480x270/v_J9Vb88L74EYBKp.mp4?tag=16"}, "poll": false, "user": {"profilePicture": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1799469009714233344/f69nVrmA_normal.jpg", "displayName": "Dustin Grage", "username": "GrageDustin"}, "content": "Now we have the Springfield City Manager acknowledging on video that they\u2019ve heard of complaints of domestic animals being eaten back in March.\n\nWe also have a call report showing this.\n\nWhy would they lie about there not being complaints?\n\nUnbelievable.", "parentTweet": false, "likes": 132}}, "post_flair_text": "", "is_crosspost": false}, {"preview": "https://media.patriots.win/preview/1994yNKQnR.png", "is_locked": false, "tweet_id": "1835678640991826345", "sticky_comment": 0, "removal_source": "", "link": "https://twitter.com/robbystarbuck/status/1835678640991826345", "author_flair_class": "", "is_video_mp4": false, "is_removed": false, "media": {"resized_resolutions": [], "blurhash": "", "full_resolution": []}, "title": "Wow.
