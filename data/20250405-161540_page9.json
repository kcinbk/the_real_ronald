This builds on the previous list and reflects the latest developments in the ongoing trade disputes.\n\n1. **Canada**  \n   - **Status**: Canada is actively negotiating with the U.S. to mitigate the 25% tariff imposed on March 4, 2025. After securing a one-month delay in February by pledging a \"fentanyl czar\" and border security measures, Canada retaliated with 25% tariffs on $20 billion in U.S. goods when talks stalled. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened further tariffs on $85 billion in U.S. exports if no deal is reached soon. Negotiations continue, with a trade delegation in Washington, but Canada is balancing diplomacy with the threat of escalation.\n\n2. **Mexico**  \n   - **Status**: Mexico faces a 25% tariff effective March 4, 2025, delayed once in February after committing 10,000 troops to its border. President Claudia Sheinbaum has held off on immediate retaliation, planning a response by March 9 if negotiations fail. Talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggest potential for partial resolution, but Mexico is under pressure to address fentanyl and migration issues alongside trade. Negotiations are ongoing, with Mexico aiming to protect its auto industry.\n\n3. **China**  \n   - **Status**: China is not negotiating in good faith yet. It faces a 34% reciprocal tariff on top of a 20% existing duty, totaling 54%. In response, China imposed 34% tariffs on U.S. goods starting April 10 and restricted rare earth exports. Beijing calls this a \"firm opposition\" to U.S. \"bullying,\" showing no immediate willingness to negotiate. The trade war is escalating, with little progress toward a deal.\n\n4. **European Union (EU)**  \n   - **Status**: The EU, hit with a 20% tariff, is preparing for talks while readying $28 billion in two-phase retaliatory tariffs (starting mid-April) if negotiations fail. In February, the EU offered to cut car tariffs from 10% to 2.5% and boost U.S. energy imports, but no agreement has been reached. EU leaders, like Ursula von der Leyen, emphasize negotiation but are poised to act if Trump doesn\u2019t soften his stance.\n\n5. **India**  \n   - **Status**: India faces a 26% tariff and has responded proactively by offering to reduce tariffs on $23 billion of U.S. imports (e.g., gems, pharmaceuticals) to address its $46 billion trade surplus with the U.S. Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s February 2025 White House visit, negotiations aim to double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. Talks are progressing, with India seeking to avoid further escalation.\n\n6. **Japan**  \n   - **Status**: Japan, under a 24% tariff, is negotiating to secure exemptions, particularly for its auto exports. Trade Minister Yoji Muto has called the tariffs \"regrettable\" and is pushing for a swift U.S. reconsideration. Japan is avoiding retaliation so far, focusing on diplomacy, but no concrete deal has emerged.\n\n7. **South Korea**  \n   - **Status**: Facing a 25% tariff, South Korea is negotiating to lessen the blow to its auto and tech sectors. Acting President Han Duck-soo has ordered emergency support for affected industries and tasked Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo with talks in Washington. Negotiations are active, but South Korea is also preparing domestic countermeasures if needed.\n\n8. **United Kingdom**  \n   - **Status**: The UK, with a 10% baseline tariff, is negotiating a broader trade deal to avoid escalation. Prime Minister Keir Starmer sees this as an opportunity to strengthen ties, keeping retaliatory options open but prioritizing talks. Progress is slow, with no firm resolution yet.\n\n9. **Australia**  \n   - **Status**: Australia, also at a 10% tariff, is negotiating to eliminate duties without invoking its Free Trade Agreement\u2019s dispute mechanisms. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has ruled out retaliation, focusing on diplomacy to maintain friendly trade relations. Talks are ongoing, with Australia hopeful for a favorable outcome.\n\n10. **Vietnam**  \n    - **Status**: Vietnam faces a steep 46% tariff but has lowered rates on U.S. cars and LNG to ease tensions. Negotiations are underway to reduce the impact on its consumer goods exports, with Vietnam showing willingness to adjust trade policies. Progress is tentative but positive.\n\n11. **Israel**  \n    - **Status**: Israel has reportedly dropped all tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs (17%), effectively concluding its negotiation by aligning with U.S. demands. This move strengthens bilateral ties, with Israel securing a favorable position early.\n\n12. **Thailand**  \n    - **Status**: Thailand, facing reciprocal tariffs (exact rate unclear), is adjusting its own tariffs and negotiating to mitigate impacts. Details are sparse, but it\u2019s actively engaging with the U.S. to protect its export-driven economy, with talks in early stages.\n\n13. **New Zealand**  \n    - **Status**: New Zealand, under a 10% tariff, is seeking discussions to address the $900 million hit to its exporters. It disputes the U.S. claim of a 20% tariff on its goods, pushing for clarity and relief in negotiations. No deal has been finalized.\n\n14. **Taiwan**  \n    - **Status**: Taiwan, hit with a 32% tariff, is negotiating to reduce the burden, calling the duties \"unreasonable.\" President Lai Ching-te has urged strong talks to safeguard Taiwan\u2019s tech exports, with prior efforts to increase U.S. energy imports showing some goodwill. Negotiations are ongoing.\n\n15. **Argentina**  \n    - **Status**: Argentina is negotiating to become the first \"zero-tariff\" country with the U.S., offering concessions to avoid reciprocal tariffs (exact rate unspecified). Talks are advancing, with Argentina leveraging its agro-industrial exports to secure a deal.\n\n16. **Italy**  \n    - **Status**: As part of the EU, Italy faces the 20% tariff but has independently signaled it won\u2019t pursue retaliatory tariffs, favoring negotiation. It\u2019s working within the EU framework and bilaterally to protect its luxury goods and auto sectors, with talks ongoing.\n\n17. **Norway**  \n    - **Status**: Norway, under a 10% tariff, is pushing for negotiations to protect its export-heavy economy. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re has called the tariffs \"serious\" and is seeking to \"put a foot in the door\" with U.S. officials. Talks are in early stages.\n\n18. **Switzerland**  \n    - **Status**: Switzerland, facing a 10% tariff, is urging quick negotiations to avoid escalation. Its business federation, Economiesuisse, calls the tariffs \"harmful,\" and the government is engaging U.S. counterparts to find solutions, with no firm progress yet.\n\n19. **Spain**  \n    - **Status**: Within the EU\u2019s 20% tariff, Spain is advocating for a united EU response but also exploring bilateral talks. Economic Minister Carlos Cuerpo emphasizes readiness to counter tariffs, with negotiations part of the broader EU strategy.\n\n20. **France**  \n    - **Status**: Also under the EU\u2019s 20% tariff, France is negotiating via the EU while President Emmanuel Macron urges companies to pause U.S. investments as leverage. Talks are tied to the EU\u2019s broader efforts, with France pushing for a strong stance.\n\n### Explanation of Negotiation Dynamics\n- **Negotiating Countries**: Most nations (e.g., Canada, Mexico, EU, Japan, South Korea, India, Vietnam, Israel, Argentina) are engaging with the U.S. to reduce or eliminate tariffs, often offering concessions like tariff cuts, border security commitments, or increased U.S. imports. Israel and Argentina stand out for their proactive alignment with U.S. demands.\n- **Resistant Countries**: China is the primary holdout, opting for retaliation over negotiation, escalating tensions. This reflects its stance against perceived U.S. unilateralism.\n- **Mixed Approaches**: The EU, UK, Australia, and others blend negotiation with the threat of retaliation, aiming to pressure Trump into concessions while avoiding an all-out trade war.\n- **Progress**: Israel has effectively concluded its talks by removing tariffs, while others like India, Vietnam, and Canada show partial progress. Most negotiations remain fluid, with deadlines like April 9 (reciprocal tariffs\u751f\u6548) and mid-April (EU retaliation) looming.\n\nThese negotiations are driven by Trump\u2019s \"reciprocal tariff\" policy, announced April 2, 2025, aiming to address trade imbalances. Countries are responding based on their economic reliance on the U.S. market, strategic priorities, and willingness to escalate or de-escalate tensions.
