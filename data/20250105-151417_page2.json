Worst comes to worst, you just offer a minor retraction. H1B visas aren\u2019t even an issue Red America cares about so no one would get too angry. Right?</p>\n<p>Wrong. Elon didn\u2019t count on a few critical realities that had changed since this H1B-visa policy first emerged as a real political issue.</p>\n<p>The first new reality Elon didn\u2019t count on was that economic case for H1Bs was WAY weaker than it was in the 90s/2000s. In 2024, America was not in the middle of a \u201ctech boom\u201d and for the last decade highly skilled natives had a very hard time finding jobs, a situation made even more depressing by the constant threat of AI to remove certain low-level positions entirely.</p>\n<p>It also didn\u2019t help that America had more information about what H1Bs actually were. Propaganda about new \u201cEinsteins\u201d and VonBrauns\u201d (the &quot;0.1% of top TOP TALENT) being brought in from the H1B expansion were transparent bullshit, since exceptional genius were brought in under and entirely different system. Furthermore, it was easy to verify through public data that H1B visas were largely given to mid-tier entry level positions, the very jobs that middle class Americans felt locked out of. The only benefit being that the foreign employees worked for less money.</p>\n<p>Further horror stories about how America was going to be \u201clocked out\u201d of a competitive market place by China and Russia were equally risible, since very notably these countries were not seeking to import a new tech elite.</p>\n<p>Elon also didn\u2019t realize that Americans had experience with these kind of immigrants that was not positive. This is an easy oversight of your brain is stuck in the 1990s where a \u201cpoint based system\u201d was the holy grail of immigration. But we tried the point system, at least in Canada, and the results are not stellar. Far from getting a new tech elite the country was just flooded with mid-skilled pushy immigrants whose economic benefit was immediately swamped by their catastrophic impact on the housing market and social services. To date, I haven't met a Canadian, even a Canadian liberal, who thinks the last decade of immigration from India has been a good thing. And for some reason, with all of this &quot;high skilled immigration&quot; Canada didn't become the new Silicon Valley either.</p>\n<p>Ok, so maybe pushing this whole H1B visas was a bad move? A political mistep? But it needed one more ingredient to become a political catastrophe. For that you neeed hordes and hordes of brain dead liberal and indian midwits, led by one paritcular indian midwit Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>\n<p>This is always from the problem with arguments that seemed like &quot;slam dunks&quot; in the past, they attract an army of midget who argue for them without evidence just to seem like they are on the &quot;winning side&quot;, smell-blind to their own bullshit. And this is more or less what happened to the defenders of H1B on Twitter. (Continued)\nSeemingly unaware the the economic logic for the policy of H1Bs had totally collapsed out from under them, the liberal defenders of more immigration resorted to their most tried and true tactic: status shaming their opponents as low status idiotic chuds.</p>\n<p>But once more, with an unbelivable lack of self-awareness, the two sides of the oneling pro-H1B debate couldn't keep their story state, firing at cross purposes, and catching each other in a HILLARIOUS crossfire.</p>\n<p>The contradiction was easy to see. Whereas the white liberal defenders of H1B wanted to status-shame middle America for being racists and not sufficiently \u201ccolor blind\u201d, the other hand, the Indian defenders of H1B wanted status shame middle America for\u2026well \u2026being white. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>Platitudes about how we needed to welcome \u201cThe Huddled masses yearning to work free in our struggling multinationals\u201d, didn\u2019t feel particularly appealing when it was buttressed by hundreds of Indians screaming about how whites were inferior and deserved to be conquered and replaced.</p>\n<p>So the conversation sounds like this:</p>\n<p>Doe-eyed Boomer liberal: \u201cGee guys, we can\u2019t be WACIST\u201d\nSome Bizarre Brown Mutant: \u201cWe are the MASTER RACE and we will CRUSH YOU, SAR!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ok, fine. Maybe this was just a lesson in how the internet was crazy? It might have been had Mr. Ramaswamy not intervened with one of the worst tweets of all time. Embodying how the WORST aspects of the pro-H1B side could exist in one brain, not on the internet, but in the real government officials that expected to rule us.</p>\n<p>What was wrong with Viveks tweet? Well, to start it sought to blame Americans for what was done to them by their government. It was also supremely condescending and tone-def. But more to the point, Vivek\u2019s words were impossible to divorce from the anti-White racial angle of the rest of the discourse on HB1s, not least because HE BROUGHT RACE into it. There was even the sort of pseudo-sexual racial contempt in Vivek\u2019s statement, a bitterness against the white football stars who got the prom Queen. The jokes wrote themselves.</p>\n<p>But it got worse. Because substantively, even the steelman of Vivek\u2019s ideas were Hogwash. At its height, Western countries always had leaders with BOTH the qualities of the sportsman and the nerd, the warrior scholar was always the Faustian ideal. America had only arrived at the idea of the \u201cNerd King\u201d lately, the focus on intellectual specialization directly corresponding to its decline. The idea that the key to success was just to grind tech knowledge harder and go full \u201ctiger mother\u201d with American kids is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>After all, that\u2019s what South Korea does. How is it working out for them?</p>\n<p>The Vivek discourse put the cherry on top of the H1B discourse, cementing the humiliation permanently and hopefully waking Americans out of a good deal of Boomer delusions.</p>\n<p>Red-pilling never fully takes for normies. But if there is anything I hope we can learn from this, it\u2019s that all politics is collective, and that you shouldn\u2019t trust sycophants who just try to simp for the \u201cwinning side\u201d because after everything is said and done you just look like an idiot.</p>\n<p>A fitting end for the \u201cElite Human Capital\u201d people.</p>\n<p>x.com/VivekGRamaswam\u2026&quot;</p>\n", "score_down": 10, "author_flair_text": "", "is_twitter": false, "is_admin": false, "pro_tier": 0, "score": 298, "suggested_sort": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "post_flair_class": "hat", "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false, "id": 7366674, "raw_content": "\"Dave Greene\n@GreeneMan6\nDec 28 \u2022 2 tweets \u2022 5 min read \u2022  Read on X https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1873070019757916633.html\n\nThe H1B debate is one of the most fascinating pieces of discourse in 2024, a humiliating defeat for the Musk, tech bros, and \u201cElite Human Capital\u201d.\n\nBut how did this happen?

The only benefit being that the foreign employees worked for less money.\n\nFurther horror stories about how America was going to be \u201clocked out\u201d of a competitive market place by China and Russia were equally risible, since very notably these countries were not seeking to import a new tech elite.\n\nElon also didn\u2019t realize that Americans had experience with these kind of immigrants that was not positive. This is an easy oversight of your brain is stuck in the 1990s where a \u201cpoint based system\u201d was the holy grail of immigration. But we tried the point system, at least in Canada, and the results are not stellar. Far from getting a new tech elite the country was just flooded with mid-skilled pushy immigrants whose economic benefit was immediately swamped by their catastrophic impact on the housing market and social services. To date, I haven't met a Canadian, even a Canadian liberal, who thinks the last decade of immigration from India has been a good thing. And for some reason, with all of this \"high skilled immigration\" Canada didn't become the new Silicon Valley either. \n\nOk, so maybe pushing this whole H1B visas was a bad move? A political mistep? But it needed one more ingredient to become a political catastrophe. For that you neeed hordes and hordes of brain dead liberal and indian midwits, led by one paritcular indian midwit Vivek Ramaswamy. \n\nThis is always from the problem with arguments that seemed like \"slam dunks\" in the past, they attract an army of midget who argue for them without evidence just to seem like they are on the \"winning side\", smell-blind to their own bullshit. And this is more or less what happened to the defenders of H1B on Twitter. (Continued) \nSeemingly unaware the the economic logic for the policy of H1Bs had totally collapsed out from under them, the liberal defenders of more immigration resorted to their most tried and true tactic: status shaming their opponents as low status idiotic chuds. \n\nBut once more, with an unbelivable lack of self-awareness, the two sides of the oneling pro-H1B debate couldn't keep their story state, firing at cross purposes, and catching each other in a HILLARIOUS crossfire.\n\nThe contradiction was easy to see. Whereas the white liberal defenders of H1B wanted to status-shame middle America for being racists and not sufficiently \u201ccolor blind\u201d, the other hand, the Indian defenders of H1B wanted status shame middle America for\u2026well \u2026being white. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t work.\n\nPlatitudes about how we needed to welcome \u201cThe Huddled masses yearning to work free in our struggling multinationals\u201d, didn\u2019t feel particularly appealing when it was buttressed by hundreds of Indians screaming about how whites were inferior and deserved to be conquered and replaced.\n\nSo the conversation sounds like this:\n\nDoe-eyed Boomer liberal: \u201cGee guys, we can\u2019t be WACIST\u201d\nSome Bizarre Brown Mutant: \u201cWe are the MASTER RACE and we will CRUSH YOU, SAR!\u201d\n\nOk, fine. Maybe this was just a lesson in how the internet was crazy? It might have been had Mr. Ramaswamy not intervened with one of the worst tweets of all time. Embodying how the WORST aspects of the pro-H1B side could exist in one brain, not on the internet, but in the real government officials that expected to rule us.\n\nWhat was wrong with Viveks tweet? Well, to start it sought to blame Americans for what was done to them by their government. It was also supremely condescending and tone-def. But more to the point, Vivek\u2019s words were impossible to divorce from the anti-White racial angle of the rest of the discourse on HB1s, not least because HE BROUGHT RACE into it. There was even the sort of pseudo-sexual racial contempt in Vivek\u2019s statement, a bitterness against the white football stars who got the prom Queen. The jokes wrote themselves.\n\nBut it got worse. Because substantively, even the steelman of Vivek\u2019s ideas were Hogwash. At its height, Western countries always had leaders with BOTH the qualities of the sportsman and the nerd, the warrior scholar was always the Faustian ideal. America had only arrived at the idea of the \u201cNerd King\u201d lately, the focus on intellectual specialization directly corresponding to its decline. The idea that the key to success was just to grind tech knowledge harder and go full \u201ctiger mother\u201d with American kids is ridiculous.\n\nAfter all, that\u2019s what South Korea does. How is it working out for them?\n\nThe Vivek discourse put the cherry on top of the H1B discourse, cementing the humiliation permanently and hopefully waking Americans out of a good deal of Boomer delusions.\n\nRed-pilling never fully takes for normies. But if there is anything I hope we can learn from this, it\u2019s that all politics is collective, and that you shouldn\u2019t trust sycophants who just try to simp for the \u201cwinning side\u201d because after everything is said and done you just look like an idiot.\n\nA fitting end for the \u201cElite Human Capital\u201d people.\n\nx.com/VivekGRamaswam\u2026\"\n", "comments": 26, "author":
