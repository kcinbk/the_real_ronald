As a result, these children are now unable to meaningfully participate in their cases and are left in the lurch,\u201d said Shaina Aber, executive director of Acacia Center for Justice.\n\nIn just the span of a few weeks, the move has resulted in sweeping staff layoffs and a disruption in legal services that could lead to attorneys withdrawing from cases.\n\n\u201cThe federal support is everything,\u201d said Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense. \u201cWe would probably see more like 90 percent of these kids going through proceedings without counsel.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, migrant children are being placed on expedited court dockets as part of efforts to speed up deportations, significantly cutting the time they have to collect evidence and present their case before an immigration judge.\n\n\u201cThis is a process that will just railroad kids through the system,\u201d Young said. \u201cThey\u2019ll receive an order to be deported from the United States without any access to due process or fundamental fairness.\u201d\n\nUnder US law, immigrants don\u2019t have a right to counsel at the government\u2019s expense, not even children, leaving them to depend on volunteer lawyers or nongovernmental organizations. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 created special protections for migrant children, including ensuring \u201cto the greatest extent practicable\u201d that they have counsel to represent them.\n\nThe Trump administration has argued in court filings that the federal government has discretion in how it distributes federal funds. \u201cAlthough, the money was authorized by Congress, Congress never mandated its spending,\u201d it wrote.\n\nA federal judge has since ordered the administration to temporarily restore funding, but to date, that hasn\u2019t happened, according to recipients of those funds.\n\nThe Trump administration has said thousands of migrant children who are seeking asylum or other legal status are unaccounted for and is trying to track them down.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s committed to doing everything he can to find these kids, but I\u2019m going to admit to you right now that\u2019s the toughest job of the three things he wants me to do. That\u2019s the toughest part of it,\u201d White House border czar Tom Homan told a special joint session of the Arizona legislature this month.\n\nExperts argue that cutting federal funds for key services runs counter to that effort, taking away the people who are helping them through the immigration system, and that includes reporting to the government.\n\nExplaining immigration court with crayons\n\nFlores tells the story of the cartoon cat, known as Fulanito to children 12 years old and under. Fulanito, in Flores\u2019 story time, crosses into the United States and eventually goes before an immigration judge, and his attorney helps him secure immigration relief. For teenagers, the group describes the immigration court process through a soccer analogy.\n\nOrganizations who work with migrant children often have to be creative to get them to open up. Staffers use coloring books, fidget toys and stress balls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll often color with children. We\u2019ll pull out a page for ourselves and color while we speak with them. It\u2019s hard to talk about heavy things while you\u2019re just staring at each other in the face,\u201d said Scott Bassett, managing attorney of the children\u2019s program at Amica Center for Immigrant Rights.\n\nYoung likened her offices to a nursery school. The lesson: how to fight your deportation proceeding.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have toddlers running all over the place, and my staff is explaining to them, using toys, crayons, chalkboards, what their rights are in the immigration system. And it\u2019s both something that\u2019s both very poignant, it\u2019s very joyful, but there\u2019s also a tremendous sense of gravity to it,\u201d Young said.\n\nColoring books and toys for children are seen at Amica Center for Immigration Rights.\nMichigan Immigrant Rights Center, which also works with unaccompanied children, uses handmade toy sets representing a courtroom for one-on-one legal screenings with kids. Kids in Need of Defense puts on puppet shows.\n\nAges range, but the importance of immigration proceedings remain the same for all who go before an immigration judge \u2013 who ultimately decides if someone stays in the United States or is removed.\n\n\u201cI was in a court last summer where a three-year-old was in proceedings. He played with his toy car in the aisle of the courtroom until he was called, and then a young woman picked him up and brought him to the front of the courtroom,\u201d Young said.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, I knew that child knew something dramatic was about to happen. He started crying. He was inconsolable at that point,\u201d she added.\n\nIn a recent court filing submitted as part of the ongoing lawsuit over terminating of funds, the Young Center\u2019s child advocates cited \u201cchildren as young as five years old sitting at tables by themselves in front of judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the days immediately following the termination of funding, Child Advocates observed immigration judges learning for the first time at court hearings that funding for legal representation and friend of court services for unaccompanied children had been terminated,\u201d the filings read.\n\n\u201cUpon arriving at court, children also learned for the first time that they would not have an attorney to represent them. In one court, Young Center Child Advocates observed a 14-year-old girl break down in tears in the court\u2019s lobby when she was told that she would not have a lawyer and would need to stand up in court all alone,\u201d it continued.\n\nReleases to guardians slow down and cases speed up\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement is charged with the care of unaccompanied migrant children until they are released to a sponsor in the United States, such as a relative or family friend.\n\nThe agency recently rolled out multiple new policies regarding the release of children to sponsors that make it more difficult for kids to be reunited with their guardians.\n\nTrump officials have argued the additional vetting of sponsors is necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety. But experts describe it as a dramatic shift that is likely to keep children in custody longer.\n\n\u201cORR has recently imposed a series of draconian sponsor vetting requirements, including restrictive ID requirements, universal fingerprinting and DNA testing,\u201d said Neha Desai, managing director of children\u2019s human rights and dignity at the National Center for Youth Law.\n\n\u201cThis has made it nearly impossible for children in ORR custody to be released if their sponsor is undocumented or if the sponsor lives with people who are undocumented \u2013 even if the child is seeking release to their parent,\u201d she added.\n\nMeanwhile, in some courtrooms, cases are being sped up to be resolved in a matter of weeks.\n\nIn a New York courtroom on Monday, an immigration judge presided over a group of seven to 10 unaccompanied minors \u2013 ranging from ages 6 to 17 and most without legal representation. They appeared virtually from government custody.\n\nThe judge guided the children through the basics of the immigration court process.\n\n\u201cJust because you can be removed doesn\u2019t mean you need to be,\u201d Judge Jennifer Durkin told them, emphasizing that their individual stories mattered. She acknowledged the intimidating nature of the proceedings, adding: \u201cMy job is to listen to why you came to the United States.\u201d\n\nThe minors, who currently reside in a government-run shelter in Brooklyn, appeared attentive. At moments, the seriousness of the hearing gave way to childhood \u2013 one boy let out a few playful giggles during the judge\u2019s questioning.\n\nTwo children were in the process of reunification with family members. One, a young girl with cerebral palsy who is currently hospitalized, was represented by counsel.

As a result, these children are now unable to meaningfully participate in their cases and are left in the lurch,\u201d said Shaina Aber, executive director of Acacia Center for Justice.</p>\n<p>In just the span of a few weeks, the move has resulted in sweeping staff layoffs and a disruption in legal services that could lead to attorneys withdrawing from cases.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe federal support is everything,\u201d said Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense. \u201cWe would probably see more like 90 percent of these kids going through proceedings without counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the same time, migrant children are being placed on expedited court dockets as part of efforts to speed up deportations, significantly cutting the time they have to collect evidence and present their case before an immigration judge.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a process that will just railroad kids through the system,\u201d Young said. \u201cThey\u2019ll receive an order to be deported from the United States without any access to due process or fundamental fairness.\u201d</p>\n<p>Under US law, immigrants don\u2019t have a right to counsel at the government\u2019s expense, not even children, leaving them to depend on volunteer lawyers or nongovernmental organizations. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 created special protections for migrant children, including ensuring \u201cto the greatest extent practicable\u201d that they have counsel to represent them.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has argued in court filings that the federal government has discretion in how it distributes federal funds. \u201cAlthough, the money was authorized by Congress, Congress never mandated its spending,\u201d it wrote.</p>\n<p>A federal judge has since ordered the administration to temporarily restore funding, but to date, that hasn\u2019t happened, according to recipients of those funds.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has said thousands of migrant children who are seeking asylum or other legal status are unaccounted for and is trying to track them down.</p>\n<p>\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s committed to doing everything he can to find these kids, but I\u2019m going to admit to you right now that\u2019s the toughest job of the three things he wants me to do. That\u2019s the toughest part of it,\u201d White House border czar Tom Homan told a special joint session of the Arizona legislature this month.</p>\n<p>Experts argue that cutting federal funds for key services runs counter to that effort, taking away the people who are helping them through the immigration system, and that includes reporting to the government.</p>\n<p>Explaining immigration court with crayons</p>\n<p>Flores tells the story of the cartoon cat, known as Fulanito to children 12 years old and under. Fulanito, in Flores\u2019 story time, crosses into the United States and eventually goes before an immigration judge, and his attorney helps him secure immigration relief. For teenagers, the group describes the immigration court process through a soccer analogy.</p>\n<p>Organizations who work with migrant children often have to be creative to get them to open up. Staffers use coloring books, fidget toys and stress balls.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll often color with children. We\u2019ll pull out a page for ourselves and color while we speak with them. It\u2019s hard to talk about heavy things while you\u2019re just staring at each other in the face,\u201d said Scott Bassett, managing attorney of the children\u2019s program at Amica Center for Immigrant Rights.</p>\n<p>Young likened her offices to a nursery school. The lesson: how to fight your deportation proceeding.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have toddlers running all over the place, and my staff is explaining to them, using toys, crayons, chalkboards, what their rights are in the immigration system. And it\u2019s both something that\u2019s both very poignant, it\u2019s very joyful, but there\u2019s also a tremendous sense of gravity to it,\u201d Young said.</p>\n<p>Coloring books and toys for children are seen at Amica Center for Immigration Rights.\nMichigan Immigrant Rights Center, which also works with unaccompanied children, uses handmade toy sets representing a courtroom for one-on-one legal screenings with kids. Kids in Need of Defense puts on puppet shows.</p>\n<p>Ages range, but the importance of immigration proceedings remain the same for all who go before an immigration judge \u2013 who ultimately decides if someone stays in the United States or is removed.</p>\n<p>\u201cI was in a court last summer where a three-year-old was in proceedings. He played with his toy car in the aisle of the courtroom until he was called, and then a young woman picked him up and brought him to the front of the courtroom,\u201d Young said.</p>\n<p>\u201cI can tell you, I knew that child knew something dramatic was about to happen. He started crying. He was inconsolable at that point,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>In a recent court filing submitted as part of the ongoing lawsuit over terminating of funds, the Young Center\u2019s child advocates cited \u201cchildren as young as five years old sitting at tables by themselves in front of judges.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDuring the days immediately following the termination of funding, Child Advocates observed immigration judges learning for the first time at court hearings that funding for legal representation and friend of court services for unaccompanied children had been terminated,\u201d the filings read.</p>\n<p>\u201cUpon arriving at court, children also learned for the first time that they would not have an attorney to represent them. In one court, Young Center Child Advocates observed a 14-year-old girl break down in tears in the court\u2019s lobby when she was told that she would not have a lawyer and would need to stand up in court all alone,\u201d it continued.</p>\n<p>Releases to guardians slow down and cases speed up</p>\n<p>The Health and Human Services Department\u2019s Office of Refugee Resettlement is charged with the care of unaccompanied migrant children until they are released to a sponsor in the United States, such as a relative or family friend.</p>\n<p>The agency recently rolled out multiple new policies regarding the release of children to sponsors that make it more difficult for kids to be reunited with their guardians.</p>\n<p>Trump officials have argued the additional vetting of sponsors is necessary to ensure the child\u2019s safety. But experts describe it as a dramatic shift that is likely to keep children in custody longer.</p>\n<p>\u201cORR has recently imposed a series of draconian sponsor vetting requirements, including restrictive ID requirements, universal fingerprinting and DNA testing,\u201d said Neha Desai, managing director of children\u2019s human rights and dignity at the National Center for Youth Law.</p>\n<p>\u201cThis has made it nearly impossible for children in ORR custody to be released if their sponsor is undocumented or if the sponsor lives with people who are undocumented \u2013 even if the child is seeking release to their parent,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in some courtrooms, cases are being sped up to be resolved in a matter of weeks.</p>\n<p>In a New York courtroom on Monday, an immigration judge presided over a group of seven to 10 unaccompanied minors \u2013 ranging from ages 6 to 17 and most without legal representation. They appeared virtually from government custody.</p>\n<p>The judge guided the children through the basics of the immigration court process.</p>\n<p>\u201cJust because you can be removed doesn\u2019t mean you need to be,\u201d Judge Jennifer Durkin told them, emphasizing that their individual stories mattered. She acknowledged the intimidating nature of the proceedings, adding: \u201cMy job is to listen to why you came to the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p>The minors, who currently reside in a government-run shelter in Brooklyn, appeared attentive. At moments, the seriousness of the hearing gave way to childhood \u2013 one boy let out a few playful giggles during the judge\u2019s questioning.</p>\n<p>Two children were in the process of reunification with family members. One, a young girl with cerebral palsy who is currently hospitalized, was represented by counsel. Her attorney informed the judge that she was being reunited with her mother.</p>\n<p>The six-year-old, the youngest in attendance, was also represented by counsel. His attorney said he was in the process of being reunited with his maternal grandmother.</p>\n<p>All the children were scheduled for a second hearing in June or July, giving those without counsel roughly two months to find legal representation.</p>\n<p>CNN\u2019s Angelica Franganillo Diaz contributed to this report.</p>\n", "score_down": 0, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0,
