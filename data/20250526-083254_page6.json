Rather, it is found in the distinctive character of its people\u2014a character forged through centuries of careful immigration, rigorous assimilation, and a shared belief in liberty, law, and responsibility. At the heart of America\u2019s success lies a paradox: we are a nation built by immigrants, yet elevated by the challenge of becoming American.</p>\n<p>Throughout our history, those who came here were not handed citizenship\u2014they earned it. They left behind everything familiar to pursue something higher: a society governed by principles rather than privilege. The United States became the &quot;cream of the crop&quot; not by accident, but because it attracted and admitted people willing to embrace the challenge of American life: hard work, self-reliance, free expression, and civic duty. They came not just for opportunity, but to contribute to a civilization rooted in the Bill of Rights and the rule of law.</p>\n<p>For this system to endure, immigration must be a meaningful process\u2014not an open gate, but a deliberate passage. Mastery of the English language, understanding of our Constitution, and reverence for the liberties we guard must be prerequisites, not afterthoughts. These aren't barriers; they are the foundation of national unity and individual empowerment.</p>\n<p>This is not a rejection of immigrants\u2014it is a defense of what makes America worth immigrating to. We are strongest when we uphold the standard, when we ensure that becoming American means something profound. The pioneers, the engineers, the risk-takers, and the moral visionaries who shaped this country did not do so by accident\u2014they did so because they shared a common civic culture, earned through discipline and belief in a larger idea.</p>\n<p>To preserve our future, we must honor our past: immigration that is disciplined, principled, and proud\u2014not only for the sake of America, but for those who truly wish to become part of its story.</p>\n", "score_down": 0, "author_flair_text": "", "pro_tier": 0, "is_stickied": false, "is_nsfw": false, "is_deleted": false, "is_image": false,
