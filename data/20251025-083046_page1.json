"raw_content": "I write this in hopes that it may bring comfort to others struggling with this decision themselves and compassion for those who are struggling with the decision others have made.\n\nGrowing up, vaccines were taught to me as the gold standard of science.  We would watch videos in class of kids bound to wheelchairs from Polio or rife with lesions from some other disease as we were taught that vaccines eliminated from our society.  This imagery was powerful and has stuck with me all my life.\n\nMost kids were extremely healthy back then.  For my friend's 10th birthday, I bought him the largest pair of underwear that an undergarment outlet store carried (size 63).  One of the kids took the underwear and put it on a girl's assigned desk in class the next day with a note that said \"We found these in the hallway and thought you would want them back.\"\n\nLooking back on the yearbook, she wasn't fat at all, maybe slightly overweight at best.  Sadly, that young man was echoing the propaganda targeted at our youth, and the yearbooks after that show her journey into bulimia.\n\nBut the propaganda has evolved since then.  COVID showed that doctors were willing to ignore safety in treatment and prevention.  We clung to life while locking our elders away from family connection.  We gave up freedoms for a life that had no inherent purpose, and we imported millions without any sort of health documentation amidst our quest to protect the immunocompromised.\n\nI have two teenagers that have grown up in great health receiving the full panel of vaccines from when they were growing up minus HPV, Flu, and COVID.  The first two were easy to say no to - they are not sexually active and are fit and healthy enough to survive a flu.  I had to take a stand for the COVID vaccination when a church camp was requiring it to attend.  I said no, and so they changed their rules that they had to at least get tested 48 hours prior to attend.  I said no, and the day before camp they said my kids could go.\n\nThe interaction was so uncomfortable that I stopped going to church altogether.  I wasn't going there for the right reasons, but I needed to find my faith before I could realize that.  If it wasn't for you guys presenting the dangers of the COVID shot, I would have easily rolled over and subjected my kids to a risk only God knows.  I learned to say \"No\" boldly in that interaction which was a blessing.\n\nFast forward to this year, God blessed me with the birth of my daughter.  A close friend chirped in my ear that the Hepatitis B vaccine at birth made no sense.  I brought this to my wife, and she agreed that we should at least delay it for a month or two.\n\nMy career is flexible enough at this point that I made a point to attend the pediatrician appointments, and the first thing I saw when I walked in was a sign recommending COVID-19 vaccinations.  I did not know God at this time, but he was meeting me at my level to tell me to RUN!  \n\nWhen vaccinations came up, they had a laundry list of a schedule that my daughter needed to take to be a part of their practice as well as quite a few recommended shots for extra safe measure.  I told the doctor that I was hesitant about the required ones, but I will allow them and say no to the extras.  My wife was not happy that I was going against the doctor's advice, but appealed to my authority on understanding that something was not right with the industry.\n\nWe kept that up for the first four months of visits, but for the sixth month visit, the appointment was cancelled - the doc was out sick.  We rescheduled only to get another cancellation.  The third reschedule was also cancelled, and by this time I was listening to God in so many other areas of my life that I could not ignore such an odd situation.\n\nTwo days before the fourth reschedule, a close friend sent me a link to the movie \"An Inconvenient Study\" that was just released.  I watched in horror as I knew that getting my wife to say no to the vaccinations was going to be impossible.  I was beyond distraught, but I knew I had to bring to her what was on my heart.  Her initial reaction was that it was not fair that my two kids that I had with my ex had the benefit of receiving the vaccines that I was asking to withhold from my daughter.\n\nThat night I attended church and the Bible Study was continuing an expositional study in Colossians.  We were at the part of wives submitting to their husbands, and husbands being gentle to their wives.  I brought this gentle attitude back home to my wife and family, and the morning before the appointment my wife agreed to watch the documentary.  What seemed impossible changed in a little over an hour as my wife told me that she couldn't let our daughters get those shots.\n\nOur doctor said that words that we wanted to hear about \"how it was our choice and he respected it\" with a smug implication that we are making a terrible decision.  He kicked us out of the practice with words like \"transitioning\" and recommended other practices that are \"vaccine-friendly\" (none of them were).  He did an exam on my daughter afterwards and found something rare (it wasn't) and recommended a new alternative for a fix by using steroids instead of estrogen to fix it (again, after researching at home, this was already the consensus treatment).  He gave us every reason to come back crawling to his practice and just accept the vaccines.\n\nGod has revealed to me first hand through my children just how unhealthy this current generation is.  Every birthday party needed accommodations for allergies and disabilities.  What exactly did we eradicate from society with these vaccines that never received the same studies that is demanded from every other medication?\n\nSo here I stand in faith in Christ in this brave new world.

We would watch videos in class of kids bound to wheelchairs from Polio or rife with lesions from some other disease as we were taught that vaccines eliminated from our society.  This imagery was powerful and has stuck with me all my life.</p>\n<p>Most kids were extremely healthy back then.  For my friend's 10th birthday, I bought him the largest pair of underwear that an undergarment outlet store carried (size 63).  One of the kids took the underwear and put it on a girl's assigned desk in class the next day with a note that said &quot;We found these in the hallway and thought you would want them back.&quot;</p>\n<p>Looking back on the yearbook, she wasn't fat at all, maybe slightly overweight at best.  Sadly, that young man was echoing the propaganda targeted at our youth, and the yearbooks after that show her journey into bulimia.</p>\n<p>But the propaganda has evolved since then.  COVID showed that doctors were willing to ignore safety in treatment and prevention.  We clung to life while locking our elders away from family connection.  We gave up freedoms for a life that had no inherent purpose, and we imported millions without any sort of health documentation amidst our quest to protect the immunocompromised.</p>\n<p>I have two teenagers that have grown up in great health receiving the full panel of vaccines from when they were growing up minus HPV, Flu, and COVID.  The first two were easy to say no to - they are not sexually active and are fit and healthy enough to survive a flu.
