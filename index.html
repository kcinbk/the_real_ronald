        I'm a dashboard summarizing what folks are chatting about on <a href="https://patriots.win/">The Donald</a>, 
        where many diehard fans of the 45th president congregate. Every few hours, I pull the <strong style="color: red;">500</strong>
        most popular posts from the landing page on The Donald, crunch some numbers and then show a picture of what they are discussing, 
        so that you don't have to go there.

        <li> Election-related posts were filtered through searching for keywords including "election", "ballot" and "votes." </li>
        <li> To identify which of these election-related posts contain potential claims of election fraud, a binary classification 
            analysis was conducted with the open-sourced <a href="https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli">DeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli</a> model. 
            (Although the zero-shot classification was not intended to be flawless and include false positives, 
            an volunteer and I had previously analyzed a sample of positive posts and found the macros satisfactory.)
