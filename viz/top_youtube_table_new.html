The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is trying to make the US remove classic cars from our lives. They are reportedly gathering information about classic cars and how their owners use them. We knew something like this was coming to the US and California would likely be first, this is concerning for many reasons. The collector car market is huge. The United States is the word's largest market for classic cars with revenue of between 14 and 15 billion U.S. dollars generated in 2020.</td>

      <td>Extremely rare copy of banned funk pop single written and performed by Nate "The Burger King" Higgs. Nate grew up in the tritip area of the tenderloin district in San Francisco in the late 70's, being raised listening to funk, soul, and the emerging genre that is now known as hip-hop and rap music. He worked as a DJ at the Lucky 13 radio station playing soul and funk during the day, and also worked at night as a producer in various local recording studios in the early 80's. Nate wrote this song expressing his frustration with his friends and music colleagues for asking Nate to restrict his speech in a socially acceptable way, especially when Nate would sing along to his favorite hit song released in 1982 titled "I Feel Like Hugging a N... Today".</td>
