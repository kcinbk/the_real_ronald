      <td>2025-06-23</td>
      <td>* (Disclaimer: The content in this video is intended for educational and informational purposes only) Moore, Oklahoma ‚Äî On June 5, 2025, Moore Police Officers responded to a house where a man, identified as Jason Girod, was reportedly inside without the homeowner's permission. Officers attempted to detain him on active warrants, but things turned full WWE. Girod asked what the warrants were for and refused to be detained by officers. Officers can be heard multiple times warning that they would taser Girod. When he still refused to comply, officers tased him. When he continued to resist, police threw him to the ground. Girod  was arrested and booked for breaking and entering, resisting arrest, and for his outstanding warrants.</td>

Trump: ‚Äì Calls out both Israel and Iran for violating the ceasefire‚Äì Criticizes Israel‚Äôs bombing campaign just hours after the peace deal‚Äì Drops a headline-making quote:‚ÄúWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt know what the F* they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù** üò≥üî• This isn‚Äôt a speech.

      <td>2023-03-24</td>
      <td>The popular understanding of The Crusades in the West is that they involved barbaric, violent Christians invading the peaceful and enlightened Islamic world. Films like Kingdom of Heaven and Mankind: The Story of Us reinforce this narrative. But the truth is the reality of the Crusades is much, much different. In fact, it's the polar opposite. In this video on Pax Tube, I explain why The Crusades were not only morally justified, but were also a historic achievement. Buckle up for a crash course in over 1,000 years of European and Middle Eastern history!</td>
