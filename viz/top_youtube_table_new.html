Her defiance escalated quickly—she was uncooperative, smelled of alcohol, and declined a sobriety test. Despite offers to conduct it privately, she resisted, even assaulting an officer. At the station, her disruptive behavior continued, showing no remorse. What began as a traffic stop turned into a serious criminal case due to her arrogance and refusal to follow the law. She was charged with DUI, battery, resisting arrest, and disobeying a lawful order, receiving two days in jail and 12 months' probation.</td>

The documentary deals with the organisation’s military training received in various African countries as well as the lesser known story of how the ANC underwent strategic training in Vietnam to implement a so-called people’s war strategy against its rival organisations. This was especially implemented against the organisation’s former ally, Inkatha, led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</td>

      <td>DC's progressive minimum wage experiment just imploded spectacularly, forcing even Democrat Mayor Bowser to beg for a repeal. Watch as we expose how the city's Initiative 82 has devastated local restaurants, with 70% cutting hours or laying off staff and a record 74 closures in 2024 alone. The same politicians who pushed for "economic justice" are now scrambling as businesses can't absorb a 25-50% labor cost increase on already razor-thin margins. Is anyone surprised that artificially manipulating market wages leads to disaster? Will other blue cities learn this $15/hour lesson before their restaurant scenes collapse too? Subscribe and share to expose how these "business-dumb" politicians experiment with your local economy while restaurant workers lose their jobs and livelihoods in the name of "progress."</td>
