      <td>2025-10-24</td>
      <td>Nahum suffered from a severe liver aneurysm that made eating painful and difficult since 2011. Doctors in Wellington warned she had only a 10% chance of survival if operated on, so they coiled the artery instead of opening her abdomen. Though her life was saved, she could only eat small amounts of food for years. While watching Apostle Mark‚Äôs online meeting, Apostle Mark prayed for people with digestive problems. Nahum lifted her hand, felt fire pass through her body, and began vomiting as the pain left her instantly. That same night, she ate a full meal for the first time in years. Apostle Mark confirmed her encounter, saying he saw Jesus standing beside her, filling her with His love and power. Following her healing, Nahum began experiencing divine favor she miraculously secured a rental home after months of rejection. Her son also received a miracle. Two years earlier, when Nahum couldn‚Äôt attend the Christchurch Miracle Revival, his teacher Ruby went on her behalf with the boy‚Äôs name written on a placard. After Apostle Mark prayed for him, the boy, who had never spoken before, began talking fluently, saying his first words: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so impressed!‚Äù He now speaks clearly and excels in mathematics. Nahum encourages other parents to trust God, saying, ‚ÄúEvery child is a gift from God. There‚Äôs nothing too hard for Him.‚Äù  Indeed, the Lord who healed Nahum‚Äôs liver also healed her son of autism to God be all the glory! God loves you, and may He bless your life as you follow Jesus,  Mark Hemans  Apostle & servant of Jesus Christ Jesus Encounter Ministries</td>

      <td>* (Disclaimer: The content in this video is intended for educational and informational purposes only) Novi, Michigan ‚Äî On Friday, October 24, 2025, police and emergency crews were called to a traffic crash near Novi Road and 10 Mile Road. Among those injured in that initial crash was 33-year-old Changlin Li, a driver involved in the collision. Paramedics from Medstar Ambulance were treating several people at the scene, including Li, who was being evaluated for injuries in or near the back of an ambulance. While medical personnel were tending to patients, Li suddenly jumped into the driver‚Äôs seat of the ambulance and sped away from the crash site, leaving responders stunned. Inside the ambulance were a paramedic and a patient who had been receiving care at the time. As Li fled, officers pursued the stolen vehicle while Medstar tracked it remotely and relayed its location to law enforcement. During the chase, Li reportedly drove over 70 mph, passed through construction zones with workers, and eventually blew a tire before running a red light at 8 Mile and Beck roads in Northville Township.</td>
