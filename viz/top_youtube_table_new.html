      <td>We've been following the ongoing fiasco concerning all things Stellantis and Dodge Charger specifically on channels like @ocmotivator  and @TKsGarage  for the last couple of months. But recently much more information about this car has been circulating, and a video done by @RichRebuilds  was the icing on the cake for us.   Childish sound effects, gimmicks and less than spectacular performance are one thing, but as it turns out the only differences between performance versions of this car and base models are all software enabled making it a giant scam on top of everything else. The Mopar tribe has been disgraced. #automobile #cars #electricvehicle</td>
