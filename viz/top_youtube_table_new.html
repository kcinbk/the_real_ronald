      <td>You’ve heard the praise, but you haven’t heard the truth. This Forgotten History Most Corrupt Series Compilation takes a hard look at three presidents often glorified in textbooks: Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Harry S. Truman. From racial segregation in the federal government, to mass surveillance, wartime censorship, internment camps, nuclear destruction, and the rise of the military-industrial complex, these men left behind legacies that shaped America, for better and for worse. History didn’t forget their sins. It covered them up. 📌 Watch until the end and decide for yourself: Were they heroes… or something else entirely? 🔔 Subscribe for more forgotten stories the mainstream won’t touch.
