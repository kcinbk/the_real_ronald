In response to Maddow belittling Trump for (rightfully) criticizing the emerging false Russiagate narrative, the senator replied, "You take on the intelligence community they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. So, even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman he's being really dumb to do it."</td>
