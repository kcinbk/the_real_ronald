      <td>2025-04-03</td>
      <td>Commerce Secretary¬†Howard Lutnick¬†says that foreign nations will need to address a host of regulatory and other policies limiting imports of American products in order to secure relief from President¬†Donald Trump‚Äôs new reciprocal levies. ‚ÄúThese non-tariff trade barriers, they are the monster that needs to be slayed,‚Äù Lutnick said in an interview on Bloomberg Television and Radio. ‚ÄúOur teams are talking to all the great trading partners today,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is time for them to do deep soul searching on how they treat us poorly and how to make it right.‚Äù Offering specific examples of non-tariff barriers, the Commerce chief said that in the European Union some countries use the region‚Äôs 20% value-added tax to subsidize their own manufacturers‚Äô production. Economists at the Council for Economic Advisers and staff at the US Trade Representative‚Äôs office have pored over foreign nations‚Äô trade barriers for decades, and that analysis formed the basis for the levies Trump announced Wednesday, Lutnick said. He also offered an example of a 2012 trade deal with South Korea which involved the US letting Korean cars into its market, with Seoul agreeing to import American agricultural products. Nevertheless, McDonald‚Äôs Corp. was unable to bring in french fries, because it was deemed not to have shown the origin of the potatoes, he said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand the scale and depth of how they keep our products out,‚Äù Lutnick said. Asked about the sell-off in equities since Trump unveiled the reciprocal tariffs Wednesday afternoon, Lutnick said the president‚Äôs focus is on addressing ‚Äúthe economic pain that the United States of America suffered over decades.‚Äù S&P 500 futures were down 3.6% as of 8:52 a.m. in New York, while the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 1.8% ‚Äî to the lowest level since October. The Commerce chief also confirmed that the new 34% surtax on China stacks on top of previous levies, including the 20% Trump imposed earlier this year over the alleged Chinese production of precursors for illegal fentanyl. ‚ÄúAll they have to have is a phone call from President Xi to Trump saying we‚Äôre going to stop fentanyl production,‚Äù Lutnick said, putting the onus on President¬†Xi Jinping. ‚ÄúAnd it would drop 20%,‚Äù he said of the tariff rate.  --------  Watch Bloomberg Radio LIVE on YouTube  Weekdays 7am-6pm ET  WATCH HERE: http://bit.ly/3vTiACF</td>

      <td>2025-04-03</td>
      <td>Senior White House officials, including Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt, sharply criticized the media on Thursday, accusing it of spreading misinformation and fear about President Donald Trump‚Äôs newly announced tariff policy, dubbed "Liberation Day." In a direct address to the public, the administration bypassed traditional press channels to outline plans for reciprocal tariffs aimed at reshoring American jobs, alleging that "globalist corporate media" were distorting facts to protect foreign interests over U.S. workers. The move, officials said, reflects a broader strategy to counter what they called decades of biased reporting that undermined national economic security.</td>
