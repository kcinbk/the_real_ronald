      <td>During a fiery U.S. Senate hearing, FBI Director Kash Patel clashed with Senator Patty Murray after she accused him of politicising the bureau. Patel shot back sharply, declaring, “I’m not going to tolerate it,” and insisted the FBI under his leadership would not be used for political retribution. His pointed rebuttal and deadpan stare drew intense reactions, underscoring the deep partisan divide.</td>

One day, Gibb, who hails from Scotland, says a woman, now being dubbed "Bagpipe Karen," got in his face and demanded he stop playing. Gibb says the 76-year-old woman took a swing at his wife. Police charged Eunice Isgur with misdemeanor assault. Gibb has returned to his favorite spot in the park and says the incident will not deter him from playing the bagpipes.</td>

From alleged shocking betrayals of trust to full-blown accused criminal behavior, these educators found themselves on the wrong side of the law – and the camera doesn’t lie.
