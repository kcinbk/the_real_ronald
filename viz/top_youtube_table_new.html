Lebowitz, the marketing director of the Pittsburgh law firm of Cohen & Grigsby, told executives at its Immigration Law Update Seminar how to advertise to make it look like there are no qualified U.S. workers. "Our goal clearly is not to find a qualified and interested U.S. worker," he said.</td>

In this video on Pax Tube, I explain why The Crusades were not only morally justified, but were also a historic achievement.
