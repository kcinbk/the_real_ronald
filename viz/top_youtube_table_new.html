Officers discover that employees had previously reported the man multiple times for making inappropriate comments to them, parking next to their vehicles, and staring at them through the windows for long periods of time - so he was trespassed from the property by police. Just 3 days later on May 23rd, Louisius Sanon returns to the Starbucks drive-thru.
