      <td>2025-07-03</td>
      <td>Mumbai Police have removed loudspeakers from approximately 1,500 places of worship across the city and its suburbs, acting on directives from the Bombay High Court and the state government. Police Commissioner Devin Bharti emphasized that the operation targeted loudspeakers in places of worship of all religions, not singling out any specific community. Bharti clarified that once removed, loudspeakers will not be reinstalled except temporarily during religious festivals, and only after obtaining prior permission in accordance with noise pollution laws. The issue gained public and political attention, especially after complaints regarding mosque loudspeakers.  BJP leader Kirt Soumya noted the removal of loudspeakers from several mosques recently. Mumbai Police reaffirmed their commitment to enforcing court orders and noise regulations at all places of worship.</td>
