      <td>2025-03-03</td>
      <td>Police bodycam footage shows the aftermath of a mother and father allegedly trying to strangle their teenage daughter in an 'honor killing'. Ihsan Ali, 44, and his wife Zahraa Subhi Mohsin Ali, 40, were charged with attempted murder, attempted kidnapping, and assault after the attack on October 18. The girl, 17, who was not named, ran away from home to Timberline High School in Lacey, Washington, after her parents tried to put her on a plane to Iraq. 'Her father had recently been threatening her with honor killing for refusing an arranged marriage with an older man in another country,' the girl told police, according to court documents. Shocking video allegedly showed Ihsan on the ground with his daughter in a chokehold outside the school, while classmates desperately tried to free her. Police bodycam footage obtained by DailyMail.com under freedom of information showed the aftermath of the attack minutes later when officers arrived at the school at 2.18pm. By then, the girl's brave 16-year-old boyfriend and his classmates had fought off Ihsan, saving her life, and adult passerby Josh Wagner restrained him on the ground. Ihsan brazenly declared to police, while in handcuffs, that his daughter would come home if he asked, despite him allegedly trying to murder her minutes earlier, while Zahraa had a meltdown over his arrest. Both the girl and her boyfriend, who was allegedly punched in the face by Ihsan while defending her, suffered numerous injuries in the fracas. The vast majority of the released footage is from the perspective of the first cop on the scene, Officer Sophal Heang, and the audio is often muted to censor certain details. Heang handcuffed Ihsan while Wagner helped hold him down until backup arrived, while his eldest daughter Haneen Ali, 21, insisted her dad did nothing wrong. 'He was trying to kill her,' one of several students a few feet away interjected, in reference to Ihsan's alleged attack on his daughter. 'My sister ran away, my mom tried to get her to talk with her... but there was this guy who held her, really aggressive,' Haneen claimed, likely about her sister's boyfriend. 'They're in there (gestures to the school building), they ran away inside.' Heang hauled Ihsan to his feet and marched him to a police car past Zahraa, who was hysterically wailing and crying. Police were unaware at this point that Zahraa allegedly also tried to strangle her daughter after classmates stopped Ihsan, or that Haneen, who has not been charged with a crime, allegedly tried to fight off students who tried to intervene. Ihsan several times demanded to speak to the daughter he allegedly tried to murder, even when Heang opened the trunk to retrieve equipment. #ishanali #honorkilling #honourkilling #timberlinehighschool</td>

      <td>Dr. Anna Machin is an Oxford University-based evolutionary anthropologist, author, and broadcaster who has spent ten years researching the psychology, biology, ​and behaviour of new fathers. Here she explains why this new-found knowledge means that we need to change how we talk about dads, moving away from lazy stereotypes, to acknowledge their unique and special role in their children's lives and the power they hold to bring about real positive changes to inequality in our society. Dr. Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist, science writer, and broadcaster based at the University of Oxford.  She researches the evolution, neuroscience, psychology and biology of our closest relationships; lover to lover, friend to friend, parent to child.
