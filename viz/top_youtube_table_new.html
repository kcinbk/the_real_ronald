      <td>US President-elect Donald Trump made a striking return to the international stage on December 7, 2024 in Paris. Trump attended the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral re-opening ceremony along with the other World leaders and notable dignitaries. The trip marked his first foreign visit since winning the US Election on November 5, 2024. During the visit, Trump engaged in a series of firm handshakes with French President Emmanuel Macron and other dignitaries. From Business tycoon Elon Musk to Jill Biden, Zelenskyy, Prince William, Salma Hayak attended the emotional reopening of the iconic cathedral. Notably, a devastating fire on April 15, 2019, destroyed the Gothic masterpiece Notre-Dame‚Äôs spire and roof, nearly causing its collapse. The 860-year-old cathedral, a symbol of France, has been meticulously restored with a new spire and revitalized architecture.</td>
