      <td>2024-12-13</td>
      <td>Missouri is considering a controversial program, Senate Bill 72, to deputize citizens as migrant bounty hunters. Proposed by Republican Senator-elect David Gregory, the bill offers a $1,000 incentive to those reporting undocumented immigrants, leading to potential arrests. It also includes restrictions on benefits and legal residency for undocumented individuals. Supporters see this as a necessary pushback against liberal immigration policies, while critics warn of racial profiling, chaos, and legal challenges. The proposal reflects growing frustrations with the Biden administration's perceived leniency on border security and surging illegal immigration. Conservative commentators highlight this as a bold step toward restoring law and order, with broader implications for national immigration debates and fiscal responsibility. Detractors, however, liken it to draconian measures, arguing it could deepen divisions and disrupt communities. As the 2024 election approaches, immigration policy remains a polarizing issue that could shape political priorities and public sentiment.</td>
