      <td>* (Disclaimer: The content in this video is intended for educational and informational purposes only) Malta, NY — On Wednesday, April 9, 2025, at approximately 1:43 p.m., New York State Police (NYSP) Troopers inside the SP Saratoga Barracks heard gunfire originating from outside the station and immediately responded to the active threat. The individual, later identified as 69-year-old David Levine, of Malta, NY, was located outside the building, standing in the parking lot armed with a long gun. Troopers instructed Levine to drop the firearm. Levine refused to follow multiple commands and aimed the gun in the direction of Troopers, at which time the Troopers fired their division-issued firearms, striking him. Levine was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators have confirmed that Levine had fired several rounds into the occupied State Police Barracks. Troopers recovered a gun at the scene.</td>

      <td>IF YOU LIKE THE VIDEO SHARE THE VIDEO.  A 1080p HD color tribute to the men who fought in World War II, specifically those who fought on D-Day.  Disclosure: All videos used are historical recordings of World War II and may not necessarily be of D-Day. Unfortunately, there isn't an over-abundance of D-day footage that was filmed, and, of the little that was, not much has survived the test of time- so I was left with little choice but to intersperse any surviving D-day footage with other World War 2 footage that, while not technically being recordings of D-Day themselves, still nonetheless capture, at least in my opinion, the spirit of the operation. Appreciate all of your kind words, glad you're able to enjoy the video despite some portion of the footage being from other theaters of World War II. Thanks!

      <td>2020-08-22</td>
      <td>Yuri Bezmenov is a name few Americans seem familiar with today. Mr. Bezmenov was a Soviet informant and KGB operative who defected to the United States in the early 70s. In an increasingly difficult to find 1984 interview with G. Edward Griffin titled “Deception Was My Job”, he laid out the four stages of “ideological subversion” created by radical Marxists to indoctrinate and weaken nations from within.</td>

      <td>This is a spectacular account of the events leading up to and through the Allied Forces' invasion of Normandy, France on D-Day (June 6), 1944 to fight the occupying Germans.    The film is particularly interesting because it looks at D-Day through the eyes of all of the participants, including the Germans, who are overwhelmed by the forces brought against them.  It is in fact a German officer who gives the story its title -- when he views the approaching Allied armada, he says, "This will be the longest day."</td>
