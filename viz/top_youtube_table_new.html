      <td>2024-12-05</td>
      <td>While many U.S. malls face anchor store closures and empty parking lots, some are finding new life by becoming housing. Real estate developers are building housing inside of or next to shopping malls as department stores like Macy‚Äôs, JCPenney and Sears shrink or cease to exist. At least 192 U.S. malls planned to add housing to their footprint as of January 2022. Dozens of apartment projects at malls are underway in California, Colorado, Florida, Arizona and Texas. The trend not only helps to chip away the housing shortage in the U.S., but also brings people closer to the remaining retail and restaurant spaces in shopping centers. CNBC visited a Macerich housing project at Flatiron Crossing Mall in Broomfield, Colorado as well as the Arcade Mall in Providence, Rhode Island to find out what it is like to live inside a mall.</td>

      <td>US President-elect Donald Trump made a striking return to the international stage on December 7, 2024 in Paris. Trump attended the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral re-opening ceremony along with the other World leaders and notable dignitaries. The trip marked his first foreign visit since winning the US Election on November 5, 2024. During the visit, Trump engaged in a series of firm handshakes with French President Emmanuel Macron and other dignitaries. From Business tycoon Elon Musk to Jill Biden, Zelenskyy, Prince William, Salma Hayak attended the emotional reopening of the iconic cathedral. Notably, a devastating fire on April 15, 2019, destroyed the Gothic masterpiece Notre-Dame‚Äôs spire and roof, nearly causing its collapse. The 860-year-old cathedral, a symbol of France, has been meticulously restored with a new spire and revitalized architecture.</td>
