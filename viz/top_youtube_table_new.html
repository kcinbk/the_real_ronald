      <td>Communism is a left-wing to far-left sociopolitical, philosophical, cultural and economic ideology within the socialist movement, whose end goal is the creation of a radical Marxist global society, a totalitarian order centered around a non-elected centralized ruling elite that enforces common ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, as well as a culturally egalitarian social order hostile to nationalism, free speech, private property, traditional family values and biologically-based gender identification or ancestral heritage.
