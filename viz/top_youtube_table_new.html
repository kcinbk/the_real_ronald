      <td>2025-07-16</td>
      <td>Una rapina, poi le coltellate e la fuga. Paura martedì mattina su un treno della linea S12 del passante ferroviario, tra Melegnano e Milano Bovisa. Un turista americano di 29 anni è stato accoltellato alla gola da tre persone nei pressi della stazione di San Giuliano Milanese, intorno alle 11.30. Secondo una prima ricostruzione, i tre avrebbero tentato di strappargli la collanina d’oro che portava al collo. Davanti alla sua reazione, lo hanno colpito con almeno un fendente. Il convoglio, partito da Melegnano alle 11:23, ha proseguito la corsa fino a San Donato, dove i tre aggressori sono scesi facendo perdere le loro tracce. Il 29enne, ferito ma cosciente, è stato aiutato dal capotreno e dai passeggeri. Sul posto è arrivata un’ambulanza in codice rosso. Dopo le prime cure, l’uomo è stato trasportato in codice giallo all’ospedale di Melegnano. Le sue condizioni non sono gravi. Le immagini che vediamo provengono da un video pubblicato dalla pagina “Instrada di San Giuliano – bella da Dio”. Mostrano la vittima distesa a terra sulla banchina, ancora sotto shock, circondata dai soccorritori.</td>
