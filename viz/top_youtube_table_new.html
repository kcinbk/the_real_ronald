Meanwhile, celebrities like Jimmy Kimmel are considering fleeing to other countries to escape Trump's policies, with Rosie O'Donnell moving to Ireland only to spend her days obsessively watching American cable news. The breakdown exposes the racial demographics behind America's most dangerous cities, the questionable qualifications of DEI-hired police chiefs, and Beto O'Rourke's bizarre call to action for Democrats.</td>
