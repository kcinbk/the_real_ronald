      <td>On today’s episode, Katarina breaks down a recently released Justice Department report detailing how the Sinaloa cartel hired a hacker in 2018 to track FBI personnel and informants in Mexico City. The hacker accessed phone data and surveillance cameras to monitor the movements of an FBI attaché and identify individuals meeting with U.S. officials. Some of those individuals were later targeted by the cartel. The episode explores how cartels are using digital tools to support their operations and what this means for U.S. law enforcement and intelligence efforts abroad.</td>
