      <td>This is a footage shot at the Walmart HQ office in Bentonville, Arkansas. Walmart has depressed wages for American workers, and often times, won't hire American workers for these jobs because it can simply CONTRACT these workers from an Indian IT consultancy company like WiPro, thereby, not having to pay full benefits as they would have to for American workers. This is why Senator Tom Cotton has co-sponsored S.386 - because he is bought by Walmart that operates this cheap labor scheme in his state.</td>
