      <td>On June 30, 2025, Lee County Port Authority (LCPA) Police Officers responded to a departing United Airlines flight after receiving a call from the crew.  Flight attendants were reporting a belligerent passenger who was refusing to exit the aircraft after being denied boarding.   Officers went on board to remove the 34-year-old woman, which resulted in passengers cheering upon seeing her being escorted off the plane.   She was taken to the LCPA police station, where she demanded a supervisor multiple times and couldn't understand why she was being detained.   She was eventually transported to the Lee County Jail, where she bailed out the next morning.  Her charges are listed at the end of the video.  Her case is still open and all suspects are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.</td>

      <td>2025-07-29</td>
      <td>This is Russell Meeks speaking on a live public television special in 1968. These shows were run without any editing in an attempt to help Americans cross partisan divides which were extreme at that time. The civil rights protests had turned violent, and many white people who were part of the protests were rejected by black protesters. I filmed several documentaries in 1968 and I can tell you from direct experience that just about everybody was angry and many people yelled at each other and at me. And it wasn't just one group or political point of view that was angry–it seemed that just about everyone was ready for if not looking for a fight. This clip presents a part of my experiences with the civil rights movement at that time. The murder of George Floyd has precipitated this kind of anger again. I sympathize with the movement to encourage the quality with the police and every other element of American society.</td>
