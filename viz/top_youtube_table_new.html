      <td>The popular understanding of The Crusades in the West is that they involved barbaric, violent Christians invading the peaceful and enlightened Islamic world. Films like Kingdom of Heaven and Mankind: The Story of Us reinforce this narrative. But the truth is the reality of the Crusades is much, much different. In fact, it's the polar opposite. In this video on Pax Tube, I explain why The Crusades were not only morally justified, but were also a historic achievement. Buckle up for a crash course in over 1,000 years of European and Middle Eastern history!</td>
