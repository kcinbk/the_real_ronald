      <td>Honey badgers are the Italian mafia of the animal kingdom. No one, and I mean no one, wants to mess with these savages. They literally woke up and chose violence on the daily.  They are regarded as the most fearless animal in the wild and they back that up every day, all while looking like a ferret on steroids. Honey badgers woke up and chose violence.  They'll combat anything from lions, leopards, hyenas and even cobras and pythons.  But how did they become so fearless?  How do these compact sized danger-weasels take on the deadliest predators like it was a regular Sunday‚Äôs brunch with the girls? These are moments of Honey Badgers being straight up savages.  Let's get into it.</td>
