While livestreaming from her Tesla in Los Angeles, agents cornered her and made the arrest, ending her three-year run in the U.S. This case highlights the growing trend of migrant “influencers” who profit off social media while breaking U.S. immigration laws. From Leonel Moreno to Tatiana Martinez, ICE is making it clear: play games online, get caught offline.</td>

It may sound unbelievable, but it’s true. A number of current American politicians were once illegal aliens. They entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas, yet rose through the system, earned citizenship, and ultimately ran for public office. Without further ado, let’s take a look at a few politicians who entered the U.S. illegally — and are now part of its leadership.</td>
