      <td>2025-04-13</td>
      <td>On April 10, the White House announced that tariffs on most goods imported from China have now reached a total of 145 percent. This comes after two rounds of retaliatory tariff increases. So far, the United States is imposing 145 percent tariffs on most Chinese imports, while China is imposing 125％ 84 percent on most US imports. However, the 145 percent rate is a lower estimate, not the ceiling. It builds on earlier tariffs introduced during former President Donald Trump’s term. These include a 25 percent tariff on steel, aluminum, cars, and auto parts. Trump also imposed tariffs of up to 25 percent on certain Chinese goods during his first term, along with other penalties for products that violated US trade rules.
