      <td>2025-05-16</td>
      <td>Japan is about to be overtaken by people from Shanghai! It is said that Chinese people are buying up almost all the real estate in Japan, with Shanghai residents leading the charge. Japanese media reported that 70% of foreign buyers in Osaka are Chinese, and 30% of them are from Shanghai. Why is everyone from Shanghai rushing to buy property in Japan this year? I heard from a Shanghai friend that there are two main reasons: First, the rental return rate for houses in Japan is very high, especially in big cities like Tokyo and Osaka, where the annual rental return rate can reach 6%. This is much better than keeping money in a bank. Second, even though Japan is not an immigration country, there are no major restrictions for foreigners to live or buy property there. As long as you have a passport, you can buy property easily. Join this channel to get access to perks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT2kPBcD6tXn8TP_aV7BmgA/join</td>

As heavy shaking was felt throughout much of Myanmar as well as other neighboring countries, the fault line moved side-to-side by as much 6 meters (20 feet) in some places, a movement which was captured by the camera in this video.
