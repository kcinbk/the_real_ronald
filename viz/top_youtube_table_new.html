      <td>Dr. Anna Machin is an Oxford University-based evolutionary anthropologist, author, and broadcaster who has spent ten years researching the psychology, biology, ​and behaviour of new fathers. Here she explains why this new-found knowledge means that we need to change how we talk about dads, moving away from lazy stereotypes, to acknowledge their unique and special role in their children's lives and the power they hold to bring about real positive changes to inequality in our society. Dr. Anna Machin is an evolutionary anthropologist, science writer, and broadcaster based at the University of Oxford.  She researches the evolution, neuroscience, psychology and biology of our closest relationships; lover to lover, friend to friend, parent to child.  She is passionate about sharing the outcomes of her work with the public and helping to make all our relationships healthier and happier. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx</td>

Some of those individuals were later targeted by the cartel. The episode explores how cartels are using digital tools to support their operations and what this means for U.S. law enforcement and intelligence efforts abroad.</td>
