      <td>Canada is rocked by a massive trucking license scandal as Ontario suspends more than 1,200 commercial drivers following revelations of widespread fraud across the testing and training system. Alberta has also taken drastic action, shutting down five driving schools and thirteen trucking companies in a sweeping crackdown. Hidden camera footage exposes instructors accepting bribes, forged documentation, and foreign workers being exploited through the notorious "$1 billion Driver Inc. scam" — where companies dodge taxes and safety standards by misclassifying employees. We uncover how the corruption spread, who’s behind it, and what must happen next to restore trust in Canada’s commercial licensing system.</td>

      <td>Discover the hidden contours of the Mellon family’s remarkable rise—a saga that begins with Thomas Mellon, an enterprising Scots-Irish immigrant who laid the groundwork for Mellon Bank. From there, his sons Andrew and Richard amassed a staggering fortune through strategic investments in Gulf Oil, Alcoa, Koppers, and beyond, cementing the Mellons as one of America’s wealthiest dynasties. Alongside storied philanthropy—think the National Gallery of Art and Carnegie Mellon University—lurk shadows of controversy, from tax fraud allegations to personal struggles that echo the scandals of other legendary clans like the Astors and Onassises. How did a family once pivotal to the Roaring Twenties navigate both towering success and whispered secrets? Delve into the Mellons’ intertwining legacies of ambition, influence, and intrigue.</td>

      <td>Karoline Leavitt defended President Donald Trump's White House East Wing demolition by reminding everyone that renovations are "something that presidents have done for years and years." Leavitt showed the media photos of previous projects at the White House, including the construction of the West Wing and the West Terrace in 1902, as well as the construction of the East Terrace, and the expansion of the West Wing expansion in 1934. "These images look quite similar to what you and the American people are seeing today," she said. "How did that rubble get there?" she added while pointing to an image of a previous construction project that dated back to the 1950s.
