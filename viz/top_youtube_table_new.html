      <td>At a Dearborn City Council meeting, Mayor Abdullah H. Hammoud told resident Edward "Ted" Barham he was "not welcome" in the city after Barham objected to new street signs honoring Arab American News publisher Osama Siblani. Barham accused Siblani of supporting Hezbollah and Hamas, quoting his past remarks. The signs were installed by Wayne County, not the city, but the exchange quickly escalated into a heated confrontation.</td>

      <td>ABC today decided to cancel their highest rated show following a controversial tweet in which Roseanne Barr compared an African-American woman, a former advisor to President Obama, to an ape. This did not sit well with ABC management, or anyone with a brain, and they announced that the show‚Äôs first season would also be its last. ‚ÄúRoseanne‚Äù was a very big hit for ABC, but just because Roseanne is gone, that doesn‚Äôt mean the show has to. The show must go on and with that said, Jimmy has an idea that could make this work for everyone.</td>

This exchange took place earlier today, on September 16, 2025, at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing.</td>
