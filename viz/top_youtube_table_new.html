      <td>Derek Chauvin’s conviction was a politically motivated miscarriage of justice, not a fair trial. From the start, the media, politicians, and activists manipulated the George Floyd case to push an anti-police agenda, ensuring Chauvin would be found guilty regardless of the facts. The jury was pressured by the threat of riots and violence, while mainstream media buried key evidence that contradicted the narrative.</td>

      <td>A Brooklyn man is facing charges for sucker punching a man on a bicycle who died years later from his injuries. Gary Anderson, 34, was walked out of the 81st Precinct in handcuffs charged with first-degree manslaughter, second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Police said the charges stem from a 2017 incident in which a man riding a bicycle on Fulton Street in Bed-Stuy was randomly sucker punched. Domingo Diego Tapia, then 38 years old, suffered severe head trauma that left him a coma. The father of two died in March 2024 after spending years in a coma. Anderson was previously convicted for the attack. According to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, Anderson pleaded guilty to assault in 2019 for the incident and was sentenced to three years in prison. The charges Anderson now faces carry a maximum prison sentence of five to 15 years.</td>
