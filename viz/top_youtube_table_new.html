      <td>2026-01-16</td>
      <td>As global economic prospects for 2026 continue to be debated, President Trump has already fired the first shot in the energy war. On January 3, the U.S. launched an airstrike on Venezuela, capturing President Maduro, marking a seismic geopolitical event. China's extensive interests in Venezuela have begun to shake violently. After the U.S. military took control of Venezuela's ports and oil facilities, the Trump administration immediately ordered the interim Venezuelan government to sever economic ties with China, Russia, Iran, and Cuba. Oil production can only be conducted in cooperation with the U.S. So, how significant is the loss for China due to this sudden change?</td>
