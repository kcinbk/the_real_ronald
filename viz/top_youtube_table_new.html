      <td>2025-12-10</td>
      <td>Dorothy Kilgallen was not just a TV personality from What’s My Line?—she was one of the most fearless investigative journalists of her era, and one of the first major voices to publicly challenge the Warren Commission’s findings on the JFK assassination. While interviewing key figures connected to the case and publishing columns that raised uncomfortable questions, she told friends she was getting close to exposing the truth. Then, in 1965, she was found dead under highly suspicious circumstances, and her JFK research notes disappeared.</td>

      <td>2025-12-09</td>
      <td>Over two years ago I showed you a video about a 62 year old grandfather named Kevin Hinton. He was driving late one night on a road trip, returning from meeting his brand-new baby granddaughter in Oregon. He was too tired to continue driving. He couldn’t keep his eyes open. So he pulled over in a public parking lot in Spokane, Washington to take a nap. He was awakened by the arrival of Sgt. Clay Hilton with the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office. Three minutes later, he would have 8 broken ribs, a punctured lung, a severe concussion, a shoulder injury, and a disfigured lip. Why? Because Sgt. Hilton thought this 62 year old grandfather was rude to him. Now, over 2 years later, there’s a huge update on my original video. Sgt. Hilton has been fired, and is now facing federal criminal charges.  Details: https://thecivilrightslawyer.com/2025/12/09/update-cop-who-beat-grandpa-napping-with-pet-cockatoo-indicted/</td>
