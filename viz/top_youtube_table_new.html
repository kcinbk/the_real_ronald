The El Salvador President has made a reputation for his brutal crackdown on gangs, and earned himself the moniker of ‚Äúworld‚Äôs coolest dictator‚Äù.</td>

Trump: ‚Äì Calls out both Israel and Iran for violating the ceasefire‚Äì Criticizes Israel‚Äôs bombing campaign just hours after the peace deal‚Äì Drops a headline-making quote:‚ÄúWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt know what the F* they‚Äôre doing.‚Äù** üò≥üî• This isn‚Äôt a speech.

      <td>2023-03-24</td>
      <td>The popular understanding of The Crusades in the West is that they involved barbaric, violent Christians invading the peaceful and enlightened Islamic world. Films like Kingdom of Heaven and Mankind: The Story of Us reinforce this narrative. But the truth is the reality of the Crusades is much, much different. In fact, it's the polar opposite. In this video on Pax Tube, I explain why The Crusades were not only morally justified, but were also a historic achievement. Buckle up for a crash course in over 1,000 years of European and Middle Eastern history!</td>
