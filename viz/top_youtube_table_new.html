      <td>IF YOU LIKE THE VIDEO SHARE THE VIDEO.  A 1080p HD color tribute to the men who fought in World War II, specifically those who fought on D-Day.  Disclosure: All videos used are historical recordings of World War II and may not necessarily be of D-Day. Unfortunately, there isn't an over-abundance of D-day footage that was filmed, and, of the little that was, not much has survived the test of time- so I was left with little choice but to intersperse any surviving D-day footage with other World War 2 footage that, while not technically being recordings of D-Day themselves, still nonetheless capture, at least in my opinion, the spirit of the operation. Appreciate all of your kind words, glad you're able to enjoy the video despite some portion of the footage being from other theaters of World War II. Thanks!

      <td>* (Disclaimer: The content in this video is intended for educational and informational purposes only) Malta, NY — On Wednesday, April 9, 2025, at approximately 1:43 p.m., New York State Police (NYSP) Troopers inside the SP Saratoga Barracks heard gunfire originating from outside the station and immediately responded to the active threat. The individual, later identified as 69-year-old David Levine, of Malta, NY, was located outside the building, standing in the parking lot armed with a long gun. Troopers instructed Levine to drop the firearm. Levine refused to follow multiple commands and aimed the gun in the direction of Troopers, at which time the Troopers fired their division-issued firearms, striking him. Levine was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators have confirmed that Levine had fired several rounds into the occupied State Police Barracks. Troopers recovered a gun at the scene.</td>
