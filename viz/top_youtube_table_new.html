      <td>2025-09-03</td>
      <td>* (Disclaimer: The content in this video is intended for educational and informational purposes only) Port St. Lucie, Florida — On September 1st, 2025, a masked thief discarded an empty jewelry box in Mattress Firm store. The manager, believing it came from the neighboring Burlington’s, walked over to speak to their manager where they indeed confirmed a theft had just occurred and the individual matched the same description of the person who discarded the jewelry box. While officers were enroute and canvassing the area, the individual matching that description was observed sitting on a near by park bench. With the balaclava still covering his face, the thief noticed officers and took off on foot!  Nearby pedestrians pointed officers to his direction where it lead them to Publix. As officers approached Publix, the thief, later identified as a 15-year-old juvenile, attempted to run out the front door where officers were waiting. This is where the body-cam footage starts! The teen runs back towards the inside of the store and that's when a 76-year-old citizen sprang into action, tackling the thief and helping to bring the chase to an end. Port St Lucie Police Department Master Sergeant Dominick Mesiti said while they’re grateful for the good samaritan's heroic act they want to remind people of the risks when assisting law enforcement.</td>

      <td>A Chinese student surnamed Gu, who planned to study philosophy at the University of Houston, was detained by U.S. Customs when he arrived at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Texas. After being questioned for 10 hours in three rounds and detained for 36 hours, he was swiftly deported and banned from entering the U.S. for five years. This incident sparked strong protests from the Chinese government and became an international news topic.

      <td>Why I Ditched the Democrats: A Former Blue Voter’s Rant Against Lies, Hypocrisy, and Corruption Once a proud Democrat raised on “Bush lied, people died,” I’ve watched the party I grew up with morph into a machine of grift, censorship, and elite double standards. From the Iraq War lies to Obama’s broken promises, the media’s “fine people” hoax, and the BLM riot cover-ups, I’m DONE with the DNC’s sanctimonious charade. They pushed lockdowns while dining mask-free, buried Hunter Biden’s laptop, and called January 6th an “insurrection” while ignoring their own dirty tricks. Now, with grand juries closing in on the liars—Letitia James, Adam Schiff, and the rest—I’m cheering for justice.
