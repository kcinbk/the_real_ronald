      <td>British Prime Minister of Kier Starmer declared that asking questions about grooming gangs in Great Britain that decimated the lives of hundreds of thousands of young girls is "far right," order to Stiny any potential inquiry into his own malfeasance.

      <td>2025-01-03</td>
      <td>Douglas Murray, Spectator columnist, joins Americano host and Spectator deputy editor Freddy Gray. This week, Home Office Minister Jess Phillips rejected Oldham Council’s request for a government-led inquiry into the horrific scandal of grooming gangs in dozens of UK cities. Her decision has led to real backlash – with X owner Elon Musk calling for safeguarding minister Jess Phillips to be jailed, and for the King to dissolve parliament. Have politicians underestimated the strength of public feeling in the UK and the US? They also discuss the Southport riots, and ask why some politicians are unwilling to confront societal problems in the name of political correctness.</td>
