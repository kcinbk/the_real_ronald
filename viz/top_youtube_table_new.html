      <td>President Trump is working on a plan to lower corporate tax rates to 15% for companies that make their products in the United States. Informal Trump economic advisor and Committee to Unleash Prosperity co-founder Stephen Moore joins Glenn to make the case that this plan, coupled with tariffs, could unleash American prosperity. But Trump might not stop there. Moore addresses whether Trump could get a “15/15/15” tax plan past Congress, meaning 15% corporate tax, 15% income tax, and 15% tariffs. “If he could pull that off,” Glenn argues, “it’s a new world!”</td>
