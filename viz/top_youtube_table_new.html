      <td>2025-05-12</td>
      <td>During a fiery U.S. Senate hearing, FBI Director Kash Patel clashed with Senator Patty Murray after she accused him of politicising the bureau. Patel shot back sharply, declaring, “I’m not going to tolerate it,” and insisted the FBI under his leadership would not be used for political retribution. His pointed rebuttal and deadpan stare drew intense reactions, underscoring the deep partisan divide.</td>

      <td>* (Disclaimer: The content in this video is intended for educational and informational purposes only) Malta, NY — On Wednesday, April 9, 2025, at approximately 1:43 p.m., New York State Police (NYSP) Troopers inside the SP Saratoga Barracks heard gunfire originating from outside the station and immediately responded to the active threat. The individual, later identified as 69-year-old David Levine, of Malta, NY, was located outside the building, standing in the parking lot armed with a long gun. Troopers instructed Levine to drop the firearm. Levine refused to follow multiple commands and aimed the gun in the direction of Troopers, at which time the Troopers fired their division-issued firearms, striking him. Levine was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Investigators have confirmed that Levine had fired several rounds into the occupied State Police Barracks. Troopers recovered a gun at the scene.</td>

      <td>This is a spectacular account of the events leading up to and through the Allied Forces' invasion of Normandy, France on D-Day (June 6), 1944 to fight the occupying Germans.    The film is particularly interesting because it looks at D-Day through the eyes of all of the participants, including the Germans, who are overwhelmed by the forces brought against them.  It is in fact a German officer who gives the story its title -- when he views the approaching Allied armada, he says, "This will be the longest day."</td>

One day, Gibb, who hails from Scotland, says a woman, now being dubbed "Bagpipe Karen," got in his face and demanded he stop playing. Gibb says the 76-year-old woman took a swing at his wife. Police charged Eunice Isgur with misdemeanor assault. Gibb has returned to his favorite spot in the park and says the incident will not deter him from playing the bagpipes.</td>
