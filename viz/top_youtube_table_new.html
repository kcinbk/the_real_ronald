      <td>The strange hadith of the encounter between Muhammad and  al-Zutt (convenient link provided by Jai & DoC: https://sunnah2.com/262) including the phrase "they began to ride the prophet of Allah" -- appears in several Islamic texts, chief among them: - ŸÖÿ≥ŸÜÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ≠ŸÜÿ®ŸÑ (Musnad al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, v. 3, p. 399, hadith# 3788). - ÿ™ÿßÿ±ŸäÿÆ ŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ÿØŸÖÿßÿ≥ŸÉŸàÿ≥ ÿ•ÿ®ŸÜ Ÿáÿ®ÿßÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá (Tarikh Medina Damascus, Ibn Hibat Allah, v. 46, p. 461). - ŸÜŸàÿ± ÿßŸÑÿØŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑŸáŸäÿ´ŸÖŸä ŸÖÿ¨ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ≤Ÿàÿßÿ¶ÿØ ŸàŸÖŸÜÿ®ÿπ ÿßŸÑŸÅŸàÿßÿ¶ÿØ  (Mujma' al-Zawa'id w Munbigh al-Fawa'd, Ibn Abi Bakr, v.8, p. 261). -  "They wounded me": ÿ£ÿÆÿ®ÿßÿ± ŸÖŸÉÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÅÿßŸÉŸáŸä (Akhbar Mecca, al-Fakahi, v. 4, p. 24). - "The penis of al-Zutt never weakens": ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ¥ÿ®ŸäŸáÿßÿ™ ŸÑÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿä ÿπŸàŸÜ (Kitab al-Tashibihat, Ibn Abi 'Awn, v. 1, p.50). - ‚ÄúWomen, dogs, and donkeys cancel a man‚Äôs prayer": ŸÖÿ≥ŸÜÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ≠ŸÜÿ®ŸÑ (Musnad al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, vol. 2, p. 2992). - ‚ÄúA woman may be compared to a cow, horse, or camel‚Äîfor all are ridden": ÿ™ŸÅÿ≥Ÿäÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ÿ∑ÿ®Ÿä ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿßŸÖÿπ ŸÑÿ£ÿ≠ŸÉÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿ±ÿ¢ŸÜ (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, v.15, p.172).  - ‚Äú... a vagina that never tires and a penis that never weakens": ÿßŸÑÿØÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿ´Ÿàÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸäŸàÿ∑Ÿä (al-Dur al-Manthur, al-Siyuti, v.1, p.211). 2022 article first mentioning this hadith: https://www.raymondibrahim.com/2022/06/20/zakaria-botros-87-and-still-boldly-challenging-islam/ Muslim responses to this hadith typically go as follows:  1) al-Zutt were Jinn, not humans;  2) The hadith is referencing the "Night of the Jinn," when Muhammad reportedly preached the Koran to them;  3) Abdullah bin Mas'ud is on record saying that he was not with Muhammad on the Night of the Jinn: therefore, the hadith is weak (ÿ∂ÿπŸäŸÅ) and likely fabricated.  As discussed in this video, however, the earliest sources all depict al-Zutt as humans, meaning the night in question had nothing to do with the Jinn, and therefore the testimony of Abdullah ‚Äî a chief and trusted transmitter of hadith ‚Äî remains valid (the one argument raised against this hadith, that Abdullah was not present during the Night of the Jinn, becomes a moot point).
