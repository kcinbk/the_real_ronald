      <td>* (Disclaimer: The content in this video is intended for educational and informational purposes only) Beaver County, Pennsylvania — On April 4, 2025, an Ohio trooper approached a man, now identified as 30-year-old Deshawn Leeth, who had crashed his vehicle on the side of the turnpike near the state line. After about 20 seconds, the man starts to run away. When he comes back toward the cruiser, the trooper uses a Taser, but it did not work and a fight begins. The video shows punches being exchanged, and at one point, Leeth gets the trooper on the ground. He was able to overpower the trooper, climbing on top of him and knocking his body camera loose. Bystanders attempted to de-escalate the situation.</td>

      <td>2025-04-13</td>
      <td>On April 10, the White House announced that tariffs on most goods imported from China have now reached a total of 145 percent. This comes after two rounds of retaliatory tariff increases. So far, the United States is imposing 145 percent tariffs on most Chinese imports, while China is imposing 125％ 84 percent on most US imports. However, the 145 percent rate is a lower estimate, not the ceiling. It builds on earlier tariffs introduced during former President Donald Trump’s term. These include a 25 percent tariff on steel, aluminum, cars, and auto parts. Trump also imposed tariffs of up to 25 percent on certain Chinese goods during his first term, along with other penalties for products that violated US trade rules.
