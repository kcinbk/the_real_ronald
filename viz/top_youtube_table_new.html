The comments of the call indicated that a male suspect stopped his vehicle in the middle of the intersection, exited, and was swinging a sword at pedestrians. Upon arrival, officers observed the suspect, later identified as 36-year-old Gurpreet Singh, standing in the intersection holding a machete. Officers gave multiple commands for Singh to drop the weapon; however, he failed to comply. Singh then returned to his vehicle, retrieved a water bottle, and threw it at the officers.</td>
