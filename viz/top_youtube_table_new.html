      <td>2025-12-10</td>
      <td>Dorothy Kilgallen was not just a TV personality from What’s My Line?—she was one of the most fearless investigative journalists of her era, and one of the first major voices to publicly challenge the Warren Commission’s findings on the JFK assassination. While interviewing key figures connected to the case and publishing columns that raised uncomfortable questions, she told friends she was getting close to exposing the truth. Then, in 1965, she was found dead under highly suspicious circumstances, and her JFK research notes disappeared.</td>

      <td>2025-12-09</td>
      <td>Over two years ago I showed you a video about a 62 year old grandfather named Kevin Hinton. He was driving late one night on a road trip, returning from meeting his brand-new baby granddaughter in Oregon. He was too tired to continue driving. He couldn’t keep his eyes open. So he pulled over in a public parking lot in Spokane, Washington to take a nap. He was awakened by the arrival of Sgt. Clay Hilton with the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office. Three minutes later, he would have 8 broken ribs, a punctured lung, a severe concussion, a shoulder injury, and a disfigured lip. Why? Because Sgt. Hilton thought this 62 year old grandfather was rude to him. Now, over 2 years later, there’s a huge update on my original video. Sgt. Hilton has been fired, and is now facing federal criminal charges.  Details: https://thecivilrightslawyer.com/2025/12/09/update-cop-who-beat-grandpa-napping-with-pet-cockatoo-indicted/</td>

      <td>2025-12-06</td>
      <td>*Get our FREE newsletter at* https://www.PrometheanAction.com — Early Friday morning, the White House quietly released a 33-page national security document that redefines America's role on the global stage. This document marks a dramatic shift from 34 years of globalist foreign policy, dating back to the Soviet Union's collapse. The new strategy focuses on ending overseas intervention unless directly tied to U.S interests, with a prioritization of American economic superiority and reindustrialization. It calls for strict immigration controls, a robust military, and a focus on domestic infrastructure against natural disasters. The strategy has prompted substantial backlash from global leaders and media alike, who view it as a threat to the established order. Barbara Boyd explains the significance of this revolutionary document, its potential implications for global politics, and the ensuing resistance from both domestic and international entities. Tune in to understand Trump's vision for America's future and why it's causing such a stir.</td>
