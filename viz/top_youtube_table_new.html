      <td>US Southern Command seized the seventh sanctioned tanker in the Caribbean Sea. Central Command posted on X: "Through #OpSouthernSpear, the @DeptofWar  is unwavering in its mission to crush illicit activity in the Western Hemisphere in partnership with @USCG,@DHSgov and@TheJusticeDept .This morning, U.S. military forces, in support of the Department of Homeland Security, apprehended Motor Vessel Sagitta without incident. The apprehension of another tanker operating in defiance of President Trump’s established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean demonstrates our resolve to ensure that the only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully. As the joint force operates in the Western Hemisphere, we reaffirm that the security of the American people is paramount, demonstrating our commitment to safety and stability. These operations are backed by the full power our elite joint force team deployed in the Caribbean."</td>
