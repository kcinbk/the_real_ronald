      <td>2025-09-27</td>
      <td>Blueberries are more than just a "superfood" in Finland — they’re a national obsession. Thanks to the country’s vast forests and the unique concept of "everyman's right," millions of Finns head out each summer to pick wild blueberries (mustikka) by hand. It’s estimated that up to 20 million kilograms of these antioxidant-rich berries are harvested annually. They end up in everything from breakfast porridge to blueberry pie (mustikkapiirakka), salads, smoothies and ice cream. Unlike the larger, cultivated varieties such as the American blueberry, Finland’s wild blueberries are smaller, darker and packed with flavor and nutrients. They’re considered a true "superfruit" — high in vitamin C, fiber and antioxidants — and deeply rooted in Finnish culinary traditions.</td>
