      <td>Join Vice President Kamala Harris‚Äô conversation in Oakland County answering Michiganders‚Äô questions about her plans for the American people. Hosted by Congresswoman Liz Cheney and moderated by Maria Shriver US Vice President and Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris participate in an election campaign event and has a conversation with Liz Cheney in Oakland City MI. US Vice President and Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris appears at an election campaign event in Birmingham, MI. Vice President Kamala Harris is making an aggressive bid to win over independents and moderate Republicans in the suburbs, visiting vote-rich counties in three Great Lakes swing states Monday with former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney. In the presidential race‚Äôs closing days, Harris‚Äô campaign is courting a small but potentially decisive group across what it sees as similar terrain in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin ‚Äî a trio of battleground states that tipped the 2016 race for Donald Trump but swung back in Democrats‚Äô favor in 2020. They‚Äôre the kinds of voters who might have backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, whose supporters in the 2024 Republican primary tended to be moderate and college-educated. And the push to reach them comes as Trump says he expects to deploy Haley in the race‚Äôs final stretch. #kamalaharris #lizcheney #trump #michigan #livenews #uselection #cnbctv18</td>

We'll talk about why this case is already one of the worst miscarriages of justice we've seen in American history. Also, the Kamala campaign has a message for "girl dads." You already expect it to be cringey; it's worse than you think. And Obama upsets some on the Left by accusing black men of sexism for not wanting to vote for Kamala. This is a complicated case of left-wing victim calculus. I'll try to break it down for you.</td>
