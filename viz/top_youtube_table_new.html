      <td>2023-09-23</td>
      <td>Slavery has existed in Africa for as long as recorded history. Ancient Egypt had slaves toiling away in its fields and on its monuments, ancient Carthage trafficked in slaves across the Mediterranean, and the Ethiopian kings of Aksum wrote proudly of the slaves they took in war. Slaves were also exported from Africa for centuries before Europeans arrived. The Trans-Saharan slave trade lasted for over a thousand years and dragged about 10 million people across the desert to be slaves in the Islamic world. The Indian Ocean also had a similarly long-lasting ocean-going slave trade with about 5 million ending up in slave ships, bound and branded for use in foreign lands. These slaves ended up as labourers, domestic servants, soldiers, or more. Male slaves in the Islamic world were typically castrated which meant that new slaves had to be regularly imported to maintain the population.</td>

      <td>The strange hadith of the encounter between Muhammad and  al-Zutt (convenient link provided by Jai & DoC: https://sunnah2.com/262) including the phrase "they began to ride the prophet of Allah" -- appears in several Islamic texts, chief among them: - مسند الإمام أحمد بن حنبل (Musnad al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, v. 3, p. 399, hadith# 3788). - تاريخ مدينة دماسكوس إبن هبات الله (Tarikh Medina Damascus, Ibn Hibat Allah, v. 46, p. 461). - نور الدين الهيثمي مجمع الزوائد ومنبع الفوائد  (Mujma' al-Zawa'id w Munbigh al-Fawa'd, Ibn Abi Bakr, v.8, p. 261). -  "They wounded me": أخبار مكة الفاكهي (Akhbar Mecca, al-Fakahi, v. 4, p. 24). - "The penis of al-Zutt never weakens": كتاب التشبيهات لابن أبي عون (Kitab al-Tashibihat, Ibn Abi 'Awn, v. 1, p.50). - “Women, dogs, and donkeys cancel a man’s prayer": مسند الإمام أحمد بن حنبل (Musnad al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, vol. 2, p. 2992). - “A woman may be compared to a cow, horse, or camel—for all are ridden": تفسير القرطبي الجامع لأحكام القرآن (Tafsir al-Qurtubi, v.15, p.172).  - “... a vagina that never tires and a penis that never weakens": الدر المنثور السيوطي (al-Dur al-Manthur, al-Siyuti, v.1, p.211). 2022 article first mentioning this hadith: https://www.raymondibrahim.com/2022/06/20/zakaria-botros-87-and-still-boldly-challenging-islam/ Muslim responses to this hadith typically go as follows:  1) al-Zutt were Jinn, not humans;  2) The hadith is referencing the "Night of the Jinn," when Muhammad reportedly preached the Koran to them;  3) Abdullah bin Mas'ud is on record saying that he was not with Muhammad on the Night of the Jinn: therefore, the hadith is weak (ضعيف) and likely fabricated.  As discussed in this video, however, the earliest sources all depict al-Zutt as humans, meaning the night in question had nothing to do with the Jinn, and therefore the testimony of Abdullah — a chief and trusted transmitter of hadith — remains valid (the one argument raised against this hadith, that Abdullah was not present during the Night of the Jinn, becomes a moot point).
