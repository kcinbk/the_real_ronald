      <td>Brazil's government has expressed outrage after 88 Brazilian deportees were flown back from the United States in handcuffs, calling the treatment "blatant disrespect" for their rights. The flight, which was initially scheduled to land in Belo Horizonte, had to make an emergency stop in Manaus due to technical issues. Brazilian officials condemned the use of restraints and promised to take up the issue with Washington. The deportees, many of whom had been detained in the U.S. for months, were later flown to their final destination with dignity and respect, under Brazil's instructions.</td>
