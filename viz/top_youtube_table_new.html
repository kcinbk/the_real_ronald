      <td>A law firm is teaching corporations how to get around hiring American workers for jobs so they can import foreign workers under the H1-B visa program. Lawrence M. Lebowitz, the marketing director of the Pittsburgh law firm of Cohen & Grigsby, told executives at its Immigration Law Update Seminar how to advertise to make it look like there are no qualified U.S. workers. "Our goal clearly is not to find a qualified and interested U.S. worker," he said.</td>

      <td>This is a footage shot at the Walmart HQ office in Bentonville, Arkansas. Walmart has depressed wages for American workers, and often times, won't hire American workers for these jobs because it can simply CONTRACT these workers from an Indian IT consultancy company like WiPro, thereby, not having to pay full benefits as they would have to for American workers. This is why Senator Tom Cotton has co-sponsored S.386 - because he is bought by Walmart that operates this cheap labor scheme in his state.</td>
