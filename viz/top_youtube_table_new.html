This did not sit well with ABC management, or anyone with a brain, and they announced that the show’s first season would also be its last. “Roseanne” was a very big hit for ABC, but just because Roseanne is gone, that doesn’t mean the show has to. The show must go on and with that said, Jimmy has an idea that could make this work for everyone.</td>
