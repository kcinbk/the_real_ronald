Watch as we expose how the city's Initiative 82 has devastated local restaurants, with 70% cutting hours or laying off staff and a record 74 closures in 2024 alone. The same politicians who pushed for "economic justice" are now scrambling as businesses can't absorb a 25-50% labor cost increase on already razor-thin margins. Is anyone surprised that artificially manipulating market wages leads to disaster? Will other blue cities learn this $15/hour lesson before their restaurant scenes collapse too?
