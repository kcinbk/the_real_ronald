The comments of the call indicated that a male suspect stopped his vehicle in the middle of the intersection, exited, and was swinging a sword at pedestrians. Upon arrival, officers observed the suspect, later identified as 36-year-old Gurpreet Singh, standing in the intersection holding a machete. Officers gave multiple commands for Singh to drop the weapon; however, he failed to comply. Singh then returned to his vehicle, retrieved a water bottle, and threw it at the officers.</td>

It may sound unbelievable, but it’s true. A number of current American politicians were once illegal aliens. They entered the country illegally or overstayed their visas, yet rose through the system, earned citizenship, and ultimately ran for public office. Without further ado, let’s take a look at a few politicians who entered the U.S. illegally — and are now part of its leadership.</td>
